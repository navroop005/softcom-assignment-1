NEW DELHI: Indian and Chinese troops physically clashed once again in the high-altitude area of Naku La in north Sikkim last week, with several soldiers being injured on both sides after Indian troops repelled an attempt by Chinese troops to enter Indian territory. The Chinese actions served as a grim reminder of the assertiveness shown by the People’s Liberation Army all along the Line of Actual Control even as Indian Army remains in a state of high alertness to respond to aggressive actions. The Indian Army on Monday said it was a “minor face-off” at Naku La on January 20, which was “resolved by local commanders as per established protocols”. The action was, however, denied by Chinese government media mouthpiece Global Times which said no clash had occurred, claiming this was fake news. The brawl took place after Indian troops challenged a bid by the PLA to once again intrude into Indian territory at Naku La, which saw both sides rush reinforcements to the area. “Though no weapons were used during the incident, injuries were sustained on both sides. It was bigger than a routine scuffle. The situation is tense but under control,” a source said. Indian and Chinese troops had also clashed at Naku La on May 9 last year, which had left several soldiers on both sides injured, just after the violent clashes on the north bank of Pangong Tso in eastern Ladakh on May 5-6 after multiple PLA incursions into Indian territory. Later, a deadly physical clash at Galwan on June 15 night claimed 20 Indian lives and an unspecified number of Chinese soldiers died too. An Indian Army lieutenant had even punched a major from the PLA during the May 9 clash at Naku La, a sector located at an altitude of about 17,000 feet that has never been contested by China in the past. Though the troop face-off at Naku La had eased after some days, the eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation still continues at the ‘friction points’ in Pangong Tso, Chushul and Gogra-Hotsprings areas of eastern Ladakh. But what had come as a surprise was PLA’s aggressive behaviour in “new areas” like Naku La, which is located ahead of Muguthang in north Sikkim. Naku La has never figured in the 23 “disputed and sensitive areas” that have witnessed frequent transgressions and troop face-offs along the 3,488-km long LAC for years. Pangong Tso figures high on the list, with the other areas in Ladakh being Trig Heights, Demchok, Dumchele, Chumar and Spanggur Gap. In Arunachal, the flashpoints are Namkha Chu, Sumdorong Chu, Asaphila, Dichu, Yangtse and the so-called ‘Fish Tail-I and II’ areas in Dibang Valley. In the middle sector, the disputed areas include Barahoti, Kaurik and Shipki La.

The search-engine giant shared a beautiful creation for people to celebrate January 26, showcasing the diversity and range of vibrant cultures that bring this colorful nation to life. "I drew inspiration from the people of India—the culture, traditions, history, and architecture," Fondekar said. Republic Day honours the date January 26, 1950, as on this date, 72 years ago, the Constitution of India came into effect by replacing the Government of India act (1935). The country officially transits to a sovereign republic. A full size illustration of Google doodleOn this day, every nook and cranny of the country, including India's capital, is decorated with people enjoying their day off. While Republic Day only dates back to 1949, many subcontinent elements have been evolving for centuries. With origins that stretch back hundreds of years, musical instruments such as the dholak (a two-headed hand drum) and the sitar (a long-necked stringed instrument), both featured in the Doodle artwork, are just a few examples of India's rich heritage. From its distinctive architectural styles to the Bollywood film industry, India's cultural impact is felt globally, and today, there is much to celebrate. Happy Republic Day, India!
