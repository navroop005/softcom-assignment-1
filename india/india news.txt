Bhawani Sharma, a nursing staff at Kanwatia Hospital in Jaipur, has been spending a lot of time these days doubling up as a self-styled counsellor. Sharma took the Covaxin jab on Saturday when the vaccination drive was rolled out across the country but found many of her colleagues hesitant to roll up their sleeves for a shot of the indigenously-developed Covaxin. “I have had no side effects,” Sharma has been going around telling others in her hospital. Five days into the nationwide drive — which saw the first phase being rolled out for healthcare workers in the frontline of Covid duty — and the dilemma whether to take the Covaxin jab has left beneficiaries in a fix. In none of the six cities, where Covaxin was made available, that TOI surveyed, did the percentage of healthcare workers going for the Covaxin shot reach 50%. Till Tuesday evening, Patna and Jaipur had clocked the highest of 49% while Mumbai and Delhi were at 31% and 33% respectively. Hospitals administering the vaccine have reported a higher percentage of beneficiaries taking the Covishield shot. “There is some hesitancy. We have seen some outright refusals too. However, what has equally contributed to the low acceptability are the glitches in the Co-Win application. We have not been able to intimate beneficiaries on time,” said Dr Lalit Sankhe, nodal officer for Covaxin at Mumbai’s JJ Hospital, the only centre in Mumbai with Covaxin. In Delhi, doctors have reported a “little higher hesitancy for Covaxin due to lack of efficacy data.” Covaxin is being administered in six central government-run hospitals in Delhi whereas Covishield is being given in all state-run and private hospitals. This has led to confusion and dissatisfaction among healthcare workers “Several doctors and PG students are not ready to take Covaxin as the third trial of this vaccine is in its initial stage. At least, the efficacy rate of Covishield is around 70% after its final trial,” said Dr Vinay Kumar, a senior resident at the AIIMS-Patna. In Pune, an official of the district hospital in Aundh said there was a general feeling among healthcare workers that they were being used as “guinea pigs”. “There are reports of anaphylactic reactions. I have decided to wait and I have also asked my junior doctors to wait,” said a senior gynecologist based in Chennai. (With inputs from Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Patna, Jaipur and Pune)

NEW DELHI: Indian and Chinese troops physically clashed once again in the high-altitude area of Naku La in north Sikkim last week, with several soldiers being injured on both sides after Indian troops repelled an attempt by Chinese troops to enter Indian territory. The Chinese actions served as a grim reminder of the assertiveness shown by the People’s Liberation Army all along the Line of Actual Control even as Indian Army remains in a state of high alertness to respond to aggressive actions. The Indian Army on Monday said it was a “minor face-off” at Naku La on January 20, which was “resolved by local commanders as per established protocols”. The action was, however, denied by Chinese government media mouthpiece Global Times which said no clash had occurred, claiming this was fake news. The brawl took place after Indian troops challenged a bid by the PLA to once again intrude into Indian territory at Naku La, which saw both sides rush reinforcements to the area. “Though no weapons were used during the incident, injuries were sustained on both sides. It was bigger than a routine scuffle. The situation is tense but under control,” a source said. Indian and Chinese troops had also clashed at Naku La on May 9 last year, which had left several soldiers on both sides injured, just after the violent clashes on the north bank of Pangong Tso in eastern Ladakh on May 5-6 after multiple PLA incursions into Indian territory. Later, a deadly physical clash at Galwan on June 15 night claimed 20 Indian lives and an unspecified number of Chinese soldiers died too. An Indian Army lieutenant had even punched a major from the PLA during the May 9 clash at Naku La, a sector located at an altitude of about 17,000 feet that has never been contested by China in the past. Though the troop face-off at Naku La had eased after some days, the eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation still continues at the ‘friction points’ in Pangong Tso, Chushul and Gogra-Hotsprings areas of eastern Ladakh. But what had come as a surprise was PLA’s aggressive behaviour in “new areas” like Naku La, which is located ahead of Muguthang in north Sikkim. Naku La has never figured in the 23 “disputed and sensitive areas” that have witnessed frequent transgressions and troop face-offs along the 3,488-km long LAC for years. Pangong Tso figures high on the list, with the other areas in Ladakh being Trig Heights, Demchok, Dumchele, Chumar and Spanggur Gap. In Arunachal, the flashpoints are Namkha Chu, Sumdorong Chu, Asaphila, Dichu, Yangtse and the so-called ‘Fish Tail-I and II’ areas in Dibang Valley. In the middle sector, the disputed areas include Barahoti, Kaurik and Shipki La.

NEW DELHI: Former Japanese PM Shinzo Abe and late singer S P Balasubrahmanyam were conferred the Padma Vibhushan on Monday, while former Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan, Dalit leader and LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan, Tarun Gogoi and Keshubhai Patel (all three posthumously) and ex-principal secretary to the PM, Nripendra Misra, have been named for the Padma Bhushan. In a list which under the Modi government has shown a tilt towards "Bharat" or the grassroots, as many as 119 Padma awards — seven Padma Vibhushan, 10 Padma Bhushan and 102 Padma Shri — were announced. Among the awardees are 29 women and one transgender, while 10 are foreigners, NRIs, persons of Indian origin or overseas citizens of India. Sixteen awards have been conferred posthumously. "Dom Raja" of Varanasi, Jagdish Chaudhary, who had signed PM Narendra Modi’s nomination papers in the 2019 LS poll, was also posthumously awarded Padma Shri for social work. Apart from Abe, who shares a good equation with Modi and is seen as a prime architect of the Indo-Pacific strategy, other foreign nationals share a strong India connect. UK filmmaker Peter Brooks, who made the well-received film "Mahabharata" based on his nine-hour play, and the late Father Valles, a Spanish Jesuit priest who lived and worked in Gujarat, have been honoured with Padma Shri. No Bharat Ratna was announced this year as well. The focus on low-profile achievers was best reflected in the selection of recipients from the art, culture and medicine categories, with many recipients hailing from the hinterland. The choice of the late Congress leader Gogoi, former CM of poll-bound Assam, is significant and will strike many as a shrewd move. B B Lal is another interesting pick in the Padma Vibhushan list. The reputed archaeologist was head of the ASI during an excavation in Ayodhya that was seen as yielding evidence of a Hindu temple — a determination which saw him being criticised by left historians but which strengthened VHP’s case for construction of a Ram Mandir at the disputed site. Three from the Sangh Parivar — former Gujarat CM Keshubhai Patel, Sumitra Mahajan and former governor Mridula Sinha, who passed away recently — too made the cut. The maximum 11 awards went to people from Tamil Nadu, incidentally another state headed for the polls. The Padma Vibhushan list included Puri-based sculptor Sudarshan Sahoo, cardiologist and Manipal University ex-chancellor B M Hegde, Islamic scholar Maulana Wahiduddin Khan and Indian-American Sikh physicist Narinder Singh Kapany, known for his work in the field of fibre optics. Playback singer K S Chithra was given the Padma Bhushan. Rattan Lal was awarded Padma Shri for regenerative agriculture. Pappammal from Coimbatore, who runs her own organic farm, was conferred Padma Shri. The 10 Padma Bhushan awardees include Islamic spiritual leader Kalbe Sadiq (posthumous), former MP and ex-chairman of National Commission for Minorities Tarlochan Singh, who has worked for the Sikh community, Kannada poet and playwright Chandrashekhar Kambara, and Maharashtra-based industrialist Rajnikant Devidas Shroff. In the Padma Shri list are former Union minister from Assam Bijoya Chakravarty. Among sportspersons in the Padma Shri list are basketball player P Anitha, table tennis player Mouma Das, athlete Sudha Hari Narayan Singh, para-sportsman K Y Venkatesh, wrestler Virender Singh and mountaineer Anshu Jamsenpa. The list, like the past few years, includes many unsung heroes in fields like art, social work, agriculture and also in a new category — grassroots innovation. From the field of trade and industry, Punjab-based Cremica founder Rajni Bector, late P Subramanian of Shanthi Gears based in Coimbatore who was also a philanthropist, and Zoho Corporation CEO Sridhar Vembu, have been conferred Padma Shri. Greek Indologist Nicholas Kazanas was awarded Padma Shri in the "literature and education" category, the former posthumously.

NEW DELHI: The Centre has asked all states and Union Territories to tighten security during Tuesday's 'Bharat Bandh' called by the farmers unions and supported by opposition parties, while asserting that peace and tranquillity must be maintained on that day, officials said. In a countrywide advisory, the Union Home Ministry also said the state governments and UT administrations must ensure that the Covid-19 guidelines issued with regard to health and social distancing are strictly followed. The 'Bharat Bandh' has been called by the farmers unions who have been protesting the three farm laws enacted in the Monsoon Session of Parliament. Major political parties on Sunday came out in strong support of the bandh. Here is all you want to know about new farm laws.  Key provisions of the lawsThe key provisions of new farm laws are intended to help small and marginal farmers (86% of total farmers) who don’t have means to either bargain for their produce to get a better price or invest in technology to improve the productivity of farms. The Act on Agri market allows farmers to sell their produce outside APMC ‘mandis’ to whoever they want. Anyone can buy their produce even at their farm gates. Though ‘commission agents’ of the ‘mandis’ and states could lose 'commissions' and 'mandi fees' respectively (the main reasons for the current protests), farmers will get better prices through competition and cost-cutting on transportation.The law on contract farming will, on the other hand, allow farmers to enter into a contract with agri-business firms or large retailers on pre-agreed prices of their produce. This will help small and marginal farmers as the legislation will transfer the risk of market unpredictability from the farmer to the sponsor. The third law seeks to remove commodities like cereals, pulses, oilseeds, edible oils, onion and potatoes from the list of essential commodities. This provision will attract private sector/foreign direct investment into the agriculture sector.  What farmers fear:Farmer unions in Punjab and Haryana say the recent laws enacted at the Centre will dismantle the minimum support price (MSP) system. Over time big corporate houses will dictate terms and farmers will end up getting less for their crops, they argue. Farmers fear that with the virtual disbanding of the mandi system, they will not get an assured price for their crops and the “arthiyas” -- commission agents who also pitch in with loans for them -- will be out of business. Farmers demands:The key demand is the withdrawal of the three laws which deregulate the sale of their crops. The farmer unions could also settle for a legal assurance that the MSP system will continue, ideally through an amendment to the laws.They are also pressing for the withdrawal of the proposed Electricity (Amendment) Bill 2020, fearing it will lead to an end to subsidised electricity. Farmers say rules against stubble burning should also not apply to them. How MSP affects farmersMSP is the minimum price paid by the government when it procures any crop from the farmers. It is announced by the state-run Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) for more than 22 commodities on an annual basis, after calculating the cost of cultivation. Food Corporation of India (FCI) -- which is the main state-run grain procurement agency -- largely buys only paddy and wheat at these prices. The FCI then sells these foodgrains at highly subsidised prices to the poor and is thereafter compensated by the government for its losses. What the government saysThe three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. Until 2020, the first sale of agriculture produce could occur only at the mandis of the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC). However, after the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 came into force it allows farmers to sell outside APMC mandis in India.

Hospitals and health centres across several cities and towns in many states and UTs could not achieve their Covid-19 vaccination targets on Tuesday thanks to continuing hesitancy among health workers in taking the shot, with a section of doctors in hospitals in Hyderabad even writing letters to their superiors, saying they would rather wait for more options before they take a jab. Reports of several cases of adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) were among the factors which caused health workers to skip the inoculations despite their names listed at the centres. “There’re cases of adverse effects being reported for the available vaccines and one is still under trial,” read a letter by a senior resident at Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (TIMS) in Hyderabad, referring to Covaxin. “I prefer to wait until there is a better vaccine available,” the doctor said in the letter. As many as 67 health workers at TIMS refused to take the jab on Tuesday. “If I take the vaccine now, I will not be able to take another vaccine in the near future, which might have better efficacy,” wrote a senior doctor from Osmania General Hospital, where less than 200 out of the 600 beneficiaries listed took the vaccine Scores of health workers skipped inoculation in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad in Maharashtra because of hesitancy. The deputy director for health services, Sanjay Deshmukh, said the refusals were due to anxiety over safety and efficacy of the vaccines. In Nagpur’s Government Medical College and Hospital, the exclusive centre for Covaxin in the city, only 29 out of 100 beneficiaries took the jab on Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: Amidst protest from opposition and a section of farmer's organisations, the Monsoon Session of the Lok Sabha passed three agriculture sector bills which will replace the existing ordinances once they are passed by the Rajya Sabha also. On Thursday, SAD leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal resigned from the Union council of ministers protesting against the bills which she said are anti-farmer and will destroy the agriculture sector in Punjab. Here is all you need to know about the three bills: 1. Bill on agri marketFarmer's Produce Trade and Commerce(Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020Provisions* To create an ecosystem where farmers and traders enjoy the freedom to sell and purchase farm produce outide registered 'mandis' under states' APMCs. * To promote barrier-free inter-state and intra-state trade of farmers' produce * To reduce marketing/transportation costs and help farmers in getting better prices * To provide a facilitative framework for electronic trading Opposition* States will lose revenue as they won't be able to collect 'mandi fees' if farmers sell their produce outside registered APMC markets. * What happens to 'commission agents' in states if entire farm trade moves out of mandis? * It may eventually end the MSP-based procurement system. * Electronic trading like in e-NAM uses physical 'mandi' structure. What will happen to e-NAM if 'mandis' are destroyed in absence of trading? New farm bill 2020: Who is protesting &amp; why2. Bill on contract farmingThe Farmer (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020Provisions* Farmers can enter into a contract with agribusiness firms, processors, wholesalers, exporters or large retailers for sale of future farming produce at a pre-agreed price * Marginal and small farmers, with land less than five hectares, to gain via aggregation and contract (Marginal and small farmers account for 86% of total farmers in India) * To transfer the risk of market unpredictability from farmers to sponsors * To enable farmers to access modern tech and get better inputs * To reduce cost of marketing and boost farmer's income. * Farmers can engage in direct marketing by eliminating intermediaries for full price realisation * Effective dispute resolution mechanism with redressal timelines. Opposition* Farmers in contract farming arrangements will be the weaker players in terms of their ability to negotiate what they need * The sponsors may not like to deal with a multitude of small and marginal farmers * Being big private companies, exporters, wholesalers and processors, the sponsors will have an edge in disputes. 3. Bill relating to commoditiesThe Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020Provisions* To remove commodities like cereals, pulses, oilseeds, onion and potatoes from the list of essential commodities. It will do away with the imposition of stockholding limits on such items except under "extraordinary circumstances" like war * This provision will attract private sector/FDI into farm sector as it will remove fears of private investors of excessive regulatory interference in business operations. * To bring investment for farm infrastructure like cold storages, and modernising food supply chain. * To help both farmers and consumers by bringing in price stability. * To create competitive market environment and cut wastage of farm produce. Opposition* Price limits for "extraordinary circumstances" are so high that they are likely to be never triggered. * Big companies will have the freedom to stock commodities- it means they will dictate terms to farmers which may lead to less prices for the cultivators. * Recent decision on export ban on onion creates doubt on its implementation.

NEW DELHI: The novel coronavirus is now spreading much more rapidly outside China than within the country, leading the world into uncharted territory, but the outbreak can still be contained, the World Health Organization said on Monday. The virus has so far claimed over 3,000 lives and there are over 90,000 confirmed cases.  What is coronavirus?Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. What are zoonotic?Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. What are the signs of infections?Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, the infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. How to prevent infection from spreading?Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Stay home when you are sick. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. Who should wear a facemask?It is not necessary for people who are well to wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases. Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others, Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said. What is the treatment for novel coronavirus?There is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for COVID-19. People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. For severe cases, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions. People who think they may have been exposed to COVID-19 should contact their healthcare provider immediately. Here is a list of dos and don'ts issued by the government to stall the spread of the virus in the country —Do's Cover your nose and mouth with disposable tissue or handkerchief Frequently wash your hands with soap and water Avoid crowded places Person suffering from Influenza like illness must be confined at home Stay more than one arm's length distance from persons sick with flu Take adequate sleep and rest Drink plenty of water/liquids and eat nutritious food Person suspected with Influenza like illness must consult doctor Don'ts Touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands while coughing or sneezing Hugging, kissing and shaking hands while greeting Spitting in public places Taking medicines without consulting doctor Disposal of used napkin or tissue paper in open areas Touching surfaces usually used by public (railing, door, gates, etc)

NEW DELHI: Several parts of the country, including Odisha, Kerala, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Delhi, are witnessing a solar eclipse on Thursday morning, which is said to the last one of the decade. The solar eclipse, which occurs when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun, began at around 8:17 am and will continue till 10:57 am today. It is also being referred to as "ring of fire" and "Surya Grahan" in Hindi. The beginning of the eclipse can be first seen from the Arabian sea coast of Oman at around 7:59 hours IST and the annular eclipse will become first visible in west of Baharain at 09:06 hours IST, Duari added. Here is all you want to know about solar eclipse.  What is a solar eclipse? A solar eclipse occurs when a portion of the Earth is engulfed in a shadow cast by the Moon which fully or partially blocks sunlight. This occurs when the Sun, Moon and Earth are aligned. Such alignment coincides with a new moon indicating the Moon is closest to the ecliptic plane. In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is obscured. If the Moon were in a perfectly circular orbit, a little closer to the Earth, and in the same orbital plane, there would be total solar eclipses every new moon. However, since the Moon's orbit is tilted at more than 5 degrees to the Earth's orbit around the Sun, its shadow usually misses Earth. A solar eclipse can only occur when the Moon is close enough to the ecliptic plane during a new moon. What is a ‘Ring of Fire’ during solar eclipse?We do not get to see a ‘Ring of Fire’ during all solar eclipses and those solar eclipses where a ‘Ring of Fire’ is visible is called an annular solar eclipse. During such an eclipse, the centre of the Sun is covered by the Moon in such a way that the outer edge of the Sun is left visible and it looks like a ring. When viewed from a long distance it looks like a ring of fire around the Moon called the 'annulus'. However, when an annular solar eclipse takes place, the ‘Ring of Fire’ is not visible from all places on earth. As a result of which the annular solar eclipse may look like a partial solar eclipse. When does an annular solar eclipse happen? We do not get to see a 'ring of fire' during all solar eclipse. For an annular solar eclipse to take place, three things need to happen — there should be a New Moon, the Moon should be at or very near a lunar node so that the Sun, Moon and the Earth all are in a straight line and the Moon should be near the apogee (the farthest point of the Moon from Earth) so that the outer edge of the Sun is visible. The 'Ring of Fire' is visible only when all these three parameters are met. When will solar eclipse start on Wednesday According to the India Meteorological Department’s Kolkata-based Positional Astronomy Centre, the solar eclipse will begin at 8am on Thursday. It will slowly increase in intensity before peaking two hours later. It will end at 1.35pm. Places where solar eclipse can be seen In Delhi, the partial eclipse will begin at 8.17am while the greatest eclipse will start at 9.30. The partial eclipse will end at 10.56am and the total duration of the eclipse will be 2 hours and 39 minutes. The solar eclipse will be at its maximum intensity at 10.47am and will remain so for a little under four minutes. The eclipse will be visible in some parts of India, Sri Lanka, UAE, Sumatra, Australia, Philippines and Singapore. People living in Ooty, Mangalore, Coimbatore, Shivagange, Tiruchirappalli and Kasaragod will be able to see the “ring of fire”. However, residents of New Delhi, Pune, Jaipur, Lucknow, Kanpur, Nagpur, Indore, Kolkata, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Surat, Bhopal, Visakhapatnam, Ludhiana and Agra will only witness a partial solar eclipse. “From India, annular phase will be visible in the morning after sunrise from some places within a narrow corridor of southern part of the country (parts of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu) and it will be seen as partial solar eclipse from the rest part of the country. The narrow corridor of annular phase of the eclipse will pass through the southern part of the country through certain places like Kannur, Coimbatore, Kozhikode, Madurai, Mangalore, Ooty, Tiruchirappalli, etc,” a bulletin of the Positional Astronomy Centre stated.  Precautions while watching the solar eclipse “The eclipse should not be viewed with the naked eye. It will cause permanent damage of the eyes even when the moon covers most portion of the sun. Safe technique to observe the solar eclipse is either by using proper filter like aluminised Mylar, black polymer and welding glass of shade number 14 or by making projection of the sun’s image on a white board by a telescope,” the bulletin stated.  Dos and donts on solar eclipseExposing your eyes to the sun without proper eye protection during a solar eclipse can cause “eclipse blindness” or retinal burns, also known as solar retinopathy, say opthalmologists. "Radiation from the sun is so powerful that regular sunglasses or lens in cameras will not be able to filter," says senior opthalmologist Dr Mohan Rajan. "Looking at the sun for more than 90 seconds exceeds threshold of retinal damage," he said. The harmful ultra violet rays from the sun can destroy cells in the retina that transmit what you see to the brain, sometimes causing permanent damage. Many times people it can occur without pain. "Symptoms can take a few hours to a few days after viewing the solar eclipse to realize the damage that has occurred," he said. Many experience loss of central vision (solar retinopathy) , distorted vision or altered color vision. Do not watch the eclipse on * Smartphone * Camera viewfinder, telescope or binoculars * Unsafe filters or glasses. Dos Use specifically designed for viewing a solar eclipse. Follow directions to use carefully

NEW DELHI: Amid the furore over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the Union Cabinet on Tuesday   approved funds   to the tune of over Rs 8,500 crore for updating the National Population Register (NPR), officials have said. The NPR exercise is to commence from April next year. The NPR is a list of "usual residents" of the country. Updating of this data was done during 2015 by conducting door-to-door survey. The digitisation of the updated information has been completed. Meanwhile, the Left parties announced a seven-day nationwide protest from January 1 to 7 and a general strike on January 8 against the CAA, the NPR and the NRC. In a joint statement, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the Communist Party of India, the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist)-Liberation, the All India Forward Bloc and the Revolutionary Socialist Party said the protest programme was announced in solidarity with the trade unions, which have also called a general strike on January 8. Now it has been decided to update the National Population Register along with the house-listing phase of Census 2021 from April to September 2020 in all the states/union territories, except Assam.  What is NPR?The National Population Register (NPR) is a register of usual residents of the country being prepared at the local (village/sub-town), sub-district, district, state and national level under provisions of the Citizenship Act 1955 and the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003. It is mandatory for every usual resident of India to register in the NPR. Under the NPR, a usual resident is defined as a person who has resided in a local area for the past six months or more or a person who intends to reside in that area for the next six months or more. What is its purpose? NPR's purpose is to create a comprehensive identity database of every usual resident in the country. The database would contain demographic as well as biometric particulars. Aadhaar, mobile number, PAN, driving license, voter ID details and Indian passport numbers are among the details that will be collected from all usual residents of India. Sharing of Aadhaar is voluntary in view of the Supreme Court ruling in this regard. What are the demographic details required?Name of person Relationship to head of household, Father’s name, Mother’s name, Spouse’s name (if married), Sex, Date of Birth, Marital status, Place of birth, Nationality (as declared), Present address of usual residence, Duration of stay at present address, Permanent residential address, Occupation/Activity, Educational qualification. What is the current status? Data for NPR was collected in 2010 during collection of data for Census of India 2011. It was updated in 2015 through a door-to-door survey. The digitisation of the updated information has been completed. NPR data will now be updated along with the house-listing phase of Census 2021 from April-September 2020 in all states except Assam. A gazette notification to this effect has already been published by the central government. Which states have blocked NPR? The West Bengal government this month stayed all activities related to the preparation and updation of NPR. The decision came amid violent protests in parts of the state over CAA and chief minister Mamata Banerjee reiterating that the law and the proposed pan-India NRC will not be implemented in the state. Mamata Banerjee said, "All activities regarding the preparation and updation of the National Population Register are stayed in West Bengal. No activity regarding NRP may be taken up without clearance from the government of West Bengal." Kerala and Rajasthan have followed suit, saying they will not work on compiling the NPR as mandated by the Centre to record 'basic information' on citizens. "After considering the concerns raised in the wake of the 2019 amendment in the Citizenship Act, the state government has decided not to cooperate with the process to update the NPR to facilitate the preparation of the NRC," the office of Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said in a statement last week. Why is Assam excludedAs of now, the NPR exercise is not being undertaken in Assam. Assam recently had the NRC exercise undertaken to identify and detain illegal immigrants. The purpose of a pan-India NRC it to detect illegal immigrants and detain them, irrespective of faith, however there are concerns it could arbitrarily exclude genuine Indian citizens. How can NPR data be accessed NPR data will not be put in the public domain but will remain a secure database accessible to the relevant user through password protected protocols. The government says it will use the data to enhance the targeting of beneficiary-oriented schemes and will have implications on improving internal security.

NEW DELHI: Amid the protests across the country over the amended Citizenship Act, the government has said that there is no link between the new law and NRC. Home minister Amit Shah had earlier set a 2024 deadline for implementing the NRC across the country. Meanwhile, the Centre on Thursday clarified that the exercise to prepare an all-India National Register for Citizens — National Register of Indian Citizens (NRIC), as per the Citizenship Rules, 2003 — was yet to be notified and as and when it is done, rules and instructions would be framed in such a way that no Indian citizen is inconvenienced. Here is all you need to know about the NRC:  What is NRC (National Register of Citizens)?NRC means the National Register of Citizens. NRC is a list of Assam's residents – prepared to identify bonafide residents and deport illegal migrants in the northeastern state bordering Bangladesh. So far, this has been a state-specific exercise to keep its ethnic uniqueness unaltered.But ever since its implementation, there has been a growing demand for its nationwide implementation. Many top BJP leaders, including home minister Amit Shah have proposed that the NRC in Assam be implemented across India. It effectively suggests to bring a legislation that will enable the government to identify infiltrators who have been living in India illegally, detain them and finally deport them where they came from. Who stands to lose?The proposed Bill, which till now remains just a proposal, if implemented will target illegal immigrants in India. But Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhist, Jains and Parsis coming from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh won't be affected, if they claim they have arrived India after fleeing religious persecution. It essentially means, if a nationwide NRC is implemented as proposed, any illegal immigrant from other than Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, will be affected. And as for those three nations, people coming from there who belong to the Muslim community will also be affected as they are not included in the Citizenship Amendment Act. Who will be excluded?As proposed, if a nationwide NRC comes in place, the affected will be detained and taken to large detention centres, as it is happening in Assam. After that, the ministry of external affairs will get in touch with the concerned nations. If the details of the detained are matched and accepted by the concerned nations, deportations will follow. Assam is setting up detention centres exclusively for those declared foreigners after exhausting all legal routes. Repatriation of such people looks difficult as India and Bangladesh do not have any treaty in this regard at this point of time. The politics of NRCAmit Shah has been raising the pitch for a nationwide NRC for some time now. As late as this October, Shah raised the matter in West Bengal, not far from Assam. In Haryana, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar too made the promise of bringing the NRC in the state during his election campaigning. Even Mohan Bhagwat, the RSS supremo has been pitching for the same, though behind closed doors. Possibility of NRC in the rest of IndiaThe Centre has been pushing for NRCs in every state. Nagaland has already started an exercise to create a similar database of citizens known as the Register of Indigenous Inhabitants. The Centre has also announced plans for a National Population Register (NPR) which will contain demographic and bio-metric details of citizens.

 What is Citizenship (Amendment) Bill?The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill seeks to provide Indian nationality to six communities — Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Parsis, Jains and Buddhists fleeing persecution from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.The bill amends the Citizenship Act, 1955 to make illegal migrants in the select categories eligible for citizenship. What does the government say:Home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday rejected the Opposition's charge that the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill was anti-Muslim, saying it does not take away the citizenship of any Indian Muslim and only seeks to given the same to persecuted minorities of three neighbouring countries. Replying to a debate on the bill in Rajya Sabha, he said the need to bring this Bill would not have arisen had Partition not taken place on the basis of religion. The Bill does not snatch citizenship of Muslims and their is no need for them to have any fear, he said. What does the opposition say:The legislation has been attacked by opposition parties, minority outfits and others for leaving out Muslims and also on the grounds that it is at odds with the Constitution, which does not differentiate between citizens on the basis of their faith. Who are the parties opposing/supporting the Bill?Congress, Trinamool, DMK, Samajwadi Party, RJD and Left, and even parties like Shiv Sena and BJD have expressed reservations. BJP's Assam ally AGP seemed to have warmed up to the idea of CAB after the government assured changes to the Bill. The government has the support of regional allies — Akali Dal and JD(U). AIADMK also voted in favour of the Bill in Rajya Sabha. Why are some northeast states opposing the Bill?The CAB has sparked resentment in the northeast as it is feared that granting citizenship to foreign refugees will undermine the ethnic communities living in these regions.There are indications that the government is working out a compromise. Formulations like provision of citizenship not leading to residency status in the smaller north-east states were discussed. Why has BJP's Assam-ally AGP taken a U-turn on CAB?In January last year, BJP's ally Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) had pulled out of NDA after Lok Sabha passed the earlier version of the Bill, which BJP had introduced in Parliament in 2016. When the Bill lapsed in the Lok Sabha, AGP returned to the alliance.Recently, the AGP has indicated a U-turn on the proposed Bill. “We have to move forward with the reality — neither can we expel lakhs of illegal migrants nor will Bangladesh ever take them back. We had our government twice in the past but we could not even identify the illegal migrants. Unfortunately, the Assam Accord has only gathered dust for over 34 years," AGP member and Assam minister Atul Bora said.

RTI Amendment Bill: Explained

NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha on Monday passed Right to Information (Amendment) Bill, after division that allows the Central government to notify the term of office for the Chief Information Commissioner (CIC) and Information Commissioners (ICs) with the Opposition slamming the measure as diluting the provisions of the legislation. The Right to Information (Amendment) Bill, 2019 was passed with 218 members voting in its favour and 79 against it after a reply by Minister of state for personnel, public grievances and pensions, Jitendra Singh. The 2005 Act was enacted during the first Congress-led government UPA government. According to the activists, the efficacy of the RTI Act, allowing any Indian to seek information from any authority on the payment of Rs 10, hinges closely on the independence of the CIC and its equivalents in the states — state information commissions that adjudicate the matter in case information is not furnished to applicants within the parameters of the law. Here is explain: What’s changed in Parliament: While Lok Sabha was never a problem, the NDA’s weakling status in the Rajya Sabha prevented it from pushing several contentious bills — with its total strength in the Upper House less than that of the Opposition. However, that may not be a problem any longer as the NDA, along with some ‘friendly’ parties such as the TRS, YSRCP, BJD and others has a strength of 127 in the 245 member House of Elders, more than the halfway mark of 123. That should help it push through the bill after it passes in the Lok Sabha. What’s in the bill: The amended bill does away with the fixed tenure of five years for the Chief Information Commissioner (CIC) and the Information Commissioners (IC) — instead, they will serve for a tenure determined by the Central government. Moreover, the salary of the CIC and the ICs which are currently benchmarked with the salary of the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and the Election Commissioners respectively, which in turn are benchmarked with the salary of a Supreme Court judge, amount to Rs 2.50 lakh, along with a monthly allowance of Rs 34,000 per month — plus the usual perks like rent free furnished accommodation and 200 litres of fuel every month. The amended bill gives the government to fix the salary, which could be lower — given that the Information Commission is a statutory body unlike the EC which is a constitutional body. However, the current incumbents’ salaries will not be affected by the amendment. How will that affect RTI? Currently, the CIC and the IC are chosen by a three member panel of the PM, the Leader of Opposition or leader of the largest opposition party in Lok Sabha and a Cabinet minister nominated by the PM. Similarly, the State Chief Information Commissioners (SCIC) and State Information Commissioners (SIC) are chosen by a three member panel comprising the state CM, the state’s leader of opposition or leader of the largest opposition party in the state assembly and a state cabinet minister nominated the chief minister. The amended bill arrogates the power of appointment and the term as well as the salary of SCIC and SIC to the Central government — which nullifies the independence of the state legislatures. Even the CIC and the ICs will serve at the pleasure of the government — raising the possibility that they would be more interested in ensuring the longevity of their tenures rather than serving the citizens’ interests. Termination of terms? Current rules stipulate that no CIC, IC, SCIC or SIC serve more than one term, for a maximum period of 5 years or till the age of 65, whichever is earlier. For ICs and SICs, if one of them is nominated to the post of CIC or SCIC, his/her total tenure as both IC and CIC or SIC and SCIC can not exceed 5 years. While the new bill gives the government the power to fix tenures, it's not clear whether an incumbent seen as pliable or ‘friendly’ to the Centre may get to serve more than one term. Appointments & dismissals: If the tenure of the CIC, IC, SCIC and SIC are to be fixed by the Centre, it may follow that their removal from office may also be dependent on the Centre — whereas in the original bill, the CIC and IC may be removed only by the President — and the state Governor in case of SCIC and SIC — after an enquiry by the Supreme Court finds reason for their dismissal from office.

NEW DELHI: Indian and Chinese troops physically clashed once again in the high-altitude area of Naku La in north Sikkim last week, with several soldiers being injured on both sides after Indian troops repelled an attempt by Chinese troops to enter Indian territory. The Chinese actions served as a grim reminder of the assertiveness shown by the People’s Liberation Army all along the Line of Actual Control even as Indian Army remains in a state of high alertness to respond to aggressive actions. The Indian Army on Monday said it was a “minor face-off” at Naku La on January 20, which was “resolved by local commanders as per established protocols”. The action was, however, denied by Chinese government media mouthpiece Global Times which said no clash had occurred, claiming this was fake news. The brawl took place after Indian troops challenged a bid by the PLA to once again intrude into Indian territory at Naku La, which saw both sides rush reinforcements to the area. “Though no weapons were used during the incident, injuries were sustained on both sides. It was bigger than a routine scuffle. The situation is tense but under control,” a source said. Indian and Chinese troops had also clashed at Naku La on May 9 last year, which had left several soldiers on both sides injured, just after the violent clashes on the north bank of Pangong Tso in eastern Ladakh on May 5-6 after multiple PLA incursions into Indian territory. Later, a deadly physical clash at Galwan on June 15 night claimed 20 Indian lives and an unspecified number of Chinese soldiers died too. An Indian Army lieutenant had even punched a major from the PLA during the May 9 clash at Naku La, a sector located at an altitude of about 17,000 feet that has never been contested by China in the past. Though the troop face-off at Naku La had eased after some days, the eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation still continues at the ‘friction points’ in Pangong Tso, Chushul and Gogra-Hotsprings areas of eastern Ladakh. But what had come as a surprise was PLA’s aggressive behaviour in “new areas” like Naku La, which is located ahead of Muguthang in north Sikkim. Naku La has never figured in the 23 “disputed and sensitive areas” that have witnessed frequent transgressions and troop face-offs along the 3,488-km long LAC for years. Pangong Tso figures high on the list, with the other areas in Ladakh being Trig Heights, Demchok, Dumchele, Chumar and Spanggur Gap. In Arunachal, the flashpoints are Namkha Chu, Sumdorong Chu, Asaphila, Dichu, Yangtse and the so-called ‘Fish Tail-I and II’ areas in Dibang Valley. In the middle sector, the disputed areas include Barahoti, Kaurik and Shipki La.

Bhawani Sharma, a nursing staff at Kanwatia Hospital in Jaipur, has been spending a lot of time these days doubling up as a self-styled counsellor. Sharma took the Covaxin jab on Saturday when the vaccination drive was rolled out across the country but found many of her colleagues hesitant to roll up their sleeves for a shot of the indigenously-developed Covaxin. “I have had no side effects,” Sharma has been going around telling others in her hospital. Five days into the nationwide drive — which saw the first phase being rolled out for healthcare workers in the frontline of Covid duty — and the dilemma whether to take the Covaxin jab has left beneficiaries in a fix. In none of the six cities, where Covaxin was made available, that TOI surveyed, did the percentage of healthcare workers going for the Covaxin shot reach 50%. Till Tuesday evening, Patna and Jaipur had clocked the highest of 49% while Mumbai and Delhi were at 31% and 33% respectively. Hospitals administering the vaccine have reported a higher percentage of beneficiaries taking the Covishield shot. “There is some hesitancy. We have seen some outright refusals too. However, what has equally contributed to the low acceptability are the glitches in the Co-Win application. We have not been able to intimate beneficiaries on time,” said Dr Lalit Sankhe, nodal officer for Covaxin at Mumbai’s JJ Hospital, the only centre in Mumbai with Covaxin. In Delhi, doctors have reported a “little higher hesitancy for Covaxin due to lack of efficacy data.” Covaxin is being administered in six central government-run hospitals in Delhi whereas Covishield is being given in all state-run and private hospitals. This has led to confusion and dissatisfaction among healthcare workers “Several doctors and PG students are not ready to take Covaxin as the third trial of this vaccine is in its initial stage. At least, the efficacy rate of Covishield is around 70% after its final trial,” said Dr Vinay Kumar, a senior resident at the AIIMS-Patna. In Pune, an official of the district hospital in Aundh said there was a general feeling among healthcare workers that they were being used as “guinea pigs”. “There are reports of anaphylactic reactions. I have decided to wait and I have also asked my junior doctors to wait,” said a senior gynecologist based in Chennai. (With inputs from Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Patna, Jaipur and Pune)

NEW DELHI: Former Japanese PM Shinzo Abe and late singer S P Balasubrahmanyam were conferred the Padma Vibhushan on Monday, while former Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan, Dalit leader and LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan, Tarun Gogoi and Keshubhai Patel (all three posthumously) and ex-principal secretary to the PM, Nripendra Misra, have been named for the Padma Bhushan. In a list which under the Modi government has shown a tilt towards "Bharat" or the grassroots, as many as 119 Padma awards — seven Padma Vibhushan, 10 Padma Bhushan and 102 Padma Shri — were announced. Among the awardees are 29 women and one transgender, while 10 are foreigners, NRIs, persons of Indian origin or overseas citizens of India. Sixteen awards have been conferred posthumously. "Dom Raja" of Varanasi, Jagdish Chaudhary, who had signed PM Narendra Modi’s nomination papers in the 2019 LS poll, was also posthumously awarded Padma Shri for social work. Apart from Abe, who shares a good equation with Modi and is seen as a prime architect of the Indo-Pacific strategy, other foreign nationals share a strong India connect. UK filmmaker Peter Brooks, who made the well-received film "Mahabharata" based on his nine-hour play, and the late Father Valles, a Spanish Jesuit priest who lived and worked in Gujarat, have been honoured with Padma Shri. No Bharat Ratna was announced this year as well. The focus on low-profile achievers was best reflected in the selection of recipients from the art, culture and medicine categories, with many recipients hailing from the hinterland. The choice of the late Congress leader Gogoi, former CM of poll-bound Assam, is significant and will strike many as a shrewd move. B B Lal is another interesting pick in the Padma Vibhushan list. The reputed archaeologist was head of the ASI during an excavation in Ayodhya that was seen as yielding evidence of a Hindu temple — a determination which saw him being criticised by left historians but which strengthened VHP’s case for construction of a Ram Mandir at the disputed site. Three from the Sangh Parivar — former Gujarat CM Keshubhai Patel, Sumitra Mahajan and former governor Mridula Sinha, who passed away recently — too made the cut. The maximum 11 awards went to people from Tamil Nadu, incidentally another state headed for the polls. The Padma Vibhushan list included Puri-based sculptor Sudarshan Sahoo, cardiologist and Manipal University ex-chancellor B M Hegde, Islamic scholar Maulana Wahiduddin Khan and Indian-American Sikh physicist Narinder Singh Kapany, known for his work in the field of fibre optics. Playback singer K S Chithra was given the Padma Bhushan. Rattan Lal was awarded Padma Shri for regenerative agriculture. Pappammal from Coimbatore, who runs her own organic farm, was conferred Padma Shri. The 10 Padma Bhushan awardees include Islamic spiritual leader Kalbe Sadiq (posthumous), former MP and ex-chairman of National Commission for Minorities Tarlochan Singh, who has worked for the Sikh community, Kannada poet and playwright Chandrashekhar Kambara, and Maharashtra-based industrialist Rajnikant Devidas Shroff. In the Padma Shri list are former Union minister from Assam Bijoya Chakravarty. Among sportspersons in the Padma Shri list are basketball player P Anitha, table tennis player Mouma Das, athlete Sudha Hari Narayan Singh, para-sportsman K Y Venkatesh, wrestler Virender Singh and mountaineer Anshu Jamsenpa. The list, like the past few years, includes many unsung heroes in fields like art, social work, agriculture and also in a new category — grassroots innovation. From the field of trade and industry, Punjab-based Cremica founder Rajni Bector, late P Subramanian of Shanthi Gears based in Coimbatore who was also a philanthropist, and Zoho Corporation CEO Sridhar Vembu, have been conferred Padma Shri. Greek Indologist Nicholas Kazanas was awarded Padma Shri in the "literature and education" category, the former posthumously.

NEW DELHI: The Centre has asked all states and Union Territories to tighten security during Tuesday's 'Bharat Bandh' called by the farmers unions and supported by opposition parties, while asserting that peace and tranquillity must be maintained on that day, officials said. In a countrywide advisory, the Union Home Ministry also said the state governments and UT administrations must ensure that the Covid-19 guidelines issued with regard to health and social distancing are strictly followed. The 'Bharat Bandh' has been called by the farmers unions who have been protesting the three farm laws enacted in the Monsoon Session of Parliament. Major political parties on Sunday came out in strong support of the bandh. Here is all you want to know about new farm laws.  Key provisions of the lawsThe key provisions of new farm laws are intended to help small and marginal farmers (86% of total farmers) who don’t have means to either bargain for their produce to get a better price or invest in technology to improve the productivity of farms. The Act on Agri market allows farmers to sell their produce outside APMC ‘mandis’ to whoever they want. Anyone can buy their produce even at their farm gates. Though ‘commission agents’ of the ‘mandis’ and states could lose 'commissions' and 'mandi fees' respectively (the main reasons for the current protests), farmers will get better prices through competition and cost-cutting on transportation.The law on contract farming will, on the other hand, allow farmers to enter into a contract with agri-business firms or large retailers on pre-agreed prices of their produce. This will help small and marginal farmers as the legislation will transfer the risk of market unpredictability from the farmer to the sponsor. The third law seeks to remove commodities like cereals, pulses, oilseeds, edible oils, onion and potatoes from the list of essential commodities. This provision will attract private sector/foreign direct investment into the agriculture sector.  What farmers fear:Farmer unions in Punjab and Haryana say the recent laws enacted at the Centre will dismantle the minimum support price (MSP) system. Over time big corporate houses will dictate terms and farmers will end up getting less for their crops, they argue. Farmers fear that with the virtual disbanding of the mandi system, they will not get an assured price for their crops and the “arthiyas” -- commission agents who also pitch in with loans for them -- will be out of business. Farmers demands:The key demand is the withdrawal of the three laws which deregulate the sale of their crops. The farmer unions could also settle for a legal assurance that the MSP system will continue, ideally through an amendment to the laws.They are also pressing for the withdrawal of the proposed Electricity (Amendment) Bill 2020, fearing it will lead to an end to subsidised electricity. Farmers say rules against stubble burning should also not apply to them. How MSP affects farmersMSP is the minimum price paid by the government when it procures any crop from the farmers. It is announced by the state-run Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) for more than 22 commodities on an annual basis, after calculating the cost of cultivation. Food Corporation of India (FCI) -- which is the main state-run grain procurement agency -- largely buys only paddy and wheat at these prices. The FCI then sells these foodgrains at highly subsidised prices to the poor and is thereafter compensated by the government for its losses. What the government saysThe three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. Until 2020, the first sale of agriculture produce could occur only at the mandis of the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC). However, after the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 came into force it allows farmers to sell outside APMC mandis in India.

Hospitals and health centres across several cities and towns in many states and UTs could not achieve their Covid-19 vaccination targets on Tuesday thanks to continuing hesitancy among health workers in taking the shot, with a section of doctors in hospitals in Hyderabad even writing letters to their superiors, saying they would rather wait for more options before they take a jab. Reports of several cases of adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) were among the factors which caused health workers to skip the inoculations despite their names listed at the centres. “There’re cases of adverse effects being reported for the available vaccines and one is still under trial,” read a letter by a senior resident at Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (TIMS) in Hyderabad, referring to Covaxin. “I prefer to wait until there is a better vaccine available,” the doctor said in the letter. As many as 67 health workers at TIMS refused to take the jab on Tuesday. “If I take the vaccine now, I will not be able to take another vaccine in the near future, which might have better efficacy,” wrote a senior doctor from Osmania General Hospital, where less than 200 out of the 600 beneficiaries listed took the vaccine Scores of health workers skipped inoculation in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad in Maharashtra because of hesitancy. The deputy director for health services, Sanjay Deshmukh, said the refusals were due to anxiety over safety and efficacy of the vaccines. In Nagpur’s Government Medical College and Hospital, the exclusive centre for Covaxin in the city, only 29 out of 100 beneficiaries took the jab on Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: Amidst protest from opposition and a section of farmer's organisations, the Monsoon Session of the Lok Sabha passed three agriculture sector bills which will replace the existing ordinances once they are passed by the Rajya Sabha also. On Thursday, SAD leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal resigned from the Union council of ministers protesting against the bills which she said are anti-farmer and will destroy the agriculture sector in Punjab. Here is all you need to know about the three bills: 1. Bill on agri marketFarmer's Produce Trade and Commerce(Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020Provisions* To create an ecosystem where farmers and traders enjoy the freedom to sell and purchase farm produce outide registered 'mandis' under states' APMCs. * To promote barrier-free inter-state and intra-state trade of farmers' produce * To reduce marketing/transportation costs and help farmers in getting better prices * To provide a facilitative framework for electronic trading Opposition* States will lose revenue as they won't be able to collect 'mandi fees' if farmers sell their produce outside registered APMC markets. * What happens to 'commission agents' in states if entire farm trade moves out of mandis? * It may eventually end the MSP-based procurement system. * Electronic trading like in e-NAM uses physical 'mandi' structure. What will happen to e-NAM if 'mandis' are destroyed in absence of trading? New farm bill 2020: Who is protesting &amp; why2. Bill on contract farmingThe Farmer (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020Provisions* Farmers can enter into a contract with agribusiness firms, processors, wholesalers, exporters or large retailers for sale of future farming produce at a pre-agreed price * Marginal and small farmers, with land less than five hectares, to gain via aggregation and contract (Marginal and small farmers account for 86% of total farmers in India) * To transfer the risk of market unpredictability from farmers to sponsors * To enable farmers to access modern tech and get better inputs * To reduce cost of marketing and boost farmer's income. * Farmers can engage in direct marketing by eliminating intermediaries for full price realisation * Effective dispute resolution mechanism with redressal timelines. Opposition* Farmers in contract farming arrangements will be the weaker players in terms of their ability to negotiate what they need * The sponsors may not like to deal with a multitude of small and marginal farmers * Being big private companies, exporters, wholesalers and processors, the sponsors will have an edge in disputes. 3. Bill relating to commoditiesThe Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020Provisions* To remove commodities like cereals, pulses, oilseeds, onion and potatoes from the list of essential commodities. It will do away with the imposition of stockholding limits on such items except under "extraordinary circumstances" like war * This provision will attract private sector/FDI into farm sector as it will remove fears of private investors of excessive regulatory interference in business operations. * To bring investment for farm infrastructure like cold storages, and modernising food supply chain. * To help both farmers and consumers by bringing in price stability. * To create competitive market environment and cut wastage of farm produce. Opposition* Price limits for "extraordinary circumstances" are so high that they are likely to be never triggered. * Big companies will have the freedom to stock commodities- it means they will dictate terms to farmers which may lead to less prices for the cultivators. * Recent decision on export ban on onion creates doubt on its implementation.

NEW DELHI: The novel coronavirus is now spreading much more rapidly outside China than within the country, leading the world into uncharted territory, but the outbreak can still be contained, the World Health Organization said on Monday. The virus has so far claimed over 3,000 lives and there are over 90,000 confirmed cases.  What is coronavirus?Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. What are zoonotic?Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. What are the signs of infections?Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, the infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. How to prevent infection from spreading?Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Stay home when you are sick. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. Who should wear a facemask?It is not necessary for people who are well to wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases. Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others, Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said. What is the treatment for novel coronavirus?There is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for COVID-19. People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. For severe cases, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions. People who think they may have been exposed to COVID-19 should contact their healthcare provider immediately. Here is a list of dos and don'ts issued by the government to stall the spread of the virus in the country —Do's Cover your nose and mouth with disposable tissue or handkerchief Frequently wash your hands with soap and water Avoid crowded places Person suffering from Influenza like illness must be confined at home Stay more than one arm's length distance from persons sick with flu Take adequate sleep and rest Drink plenty of water/liquids and eat nutritious food Person suspected with Influenza like illness must consult doctor Don'ts Touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands while coughing or sneezing Hugging, kissing and shaking hands while greeting Spitting in public places Taking medicines without consulting doctor Disposal of used napkin or tissue paper in open areas Touching surfaces usually used by public (railing, door, gates, etc)

What is solar eclipse and how does it occur?

NEW DELHI: Several parts of the country, including Odisha, Kerala, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Delhi, are witnessing a solar eclipse on Thursday morning, which is said to the last one of the decade. The solar eclipse, which occurs when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun, began at around 8:17 am and will continue till 10:57 am today. It is also being referred to as "ring of fire" and "Surya Grahan" in Hindi. The beginning of the eclipse can be first seen from the Arabian sea coast of Oman at around 7:59 hours IST and the annular eclipse will become first visible in west of Baharain at 09:06 hours IST, Duari added. Here is all you want to know about solar eclipse.  What is a solar eclipse? A solar eclipse occurs when a portion of the Earth is engulfed in a shadow cast by the Moon which fully or partially blocks sunlight. This occurs when the Sun, Moon and Earth are aligned. Such alignment coincides with a new moon indicating the Moon is closest to the ecliptic plane. In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is obscured. If the Moon were in a perfectly circular orbit, a little closer to the Earth, and in the same orbital plane, there would be total solar eclipses every new moon. However, since the Moon's orbit is tilted at more than 5 degrees to the Earth's orbit around the Sun, its shadow usually misses Earth. A solar eclipse can only occur when the Moon is close enough to the ecliptic plane during a new moon. What is a ‘Ring of Fire’ during solar eclipse?We do not get to see a ‘Ring of Fire’ during all solar eclipses and those solar eclipses where a ‘Ring of Fire’ is visible is called an annular solar eclipse. During such an eclipse, the centre of the Sun is covered by the Moon in such a way that the outer edge of the Sun is left visible and it looks like a ring. When viewed from a long distance it looks like a ring of fire around the Moon called the 'annulus'. However, when an annular solar eclipse takes place, the ‘Ring of Fire’ is not visible from all places on earth. As a result of which the annular solar eclipse may look like a partial solar eclipse. When does an annular solar eclipse happen? We do not get to see a 'ring of fire' during all solar eclipse. For an annular solar eclipse to take place, three things need to happen — there should be a New Moon, the Moon should be at or very near a lunar node so that the Sun, Moon and the Earth all are in a straight line and the Moon should be near the apogee (the farthest point of the Moon from Earth) so that the outer edge of the Sun is visible. The 'Ring of Fire' is visible only when all these three parameters are met. When will solar eclipse start on Wednesday According to the India Meteorological Department’s Kolkata-based Positional Astronomy Centre, the solar eclipse will begin at 8am on Thursday. It will slowly increase in intensity before peaking two hours later. It will end at 1.35pm. Places where solar eclipse can be seen In Delhi, the partial eclipse will begin at 8.17am while the greatest eclipse will start at 9.30. The partial eclipse will end at 10.56am and the total duration of the eclipse will be 2 hours and 39 minutes. The solar eclipse will be at its maximum intensity at 10.47am and will remain so for a little under four minutes. The eclipse will be visible in some parts of India, Sri Lanka, UAE, Sumatra, Australia, Philippines and Singapore. People living in Ooty, Mangalore, Coimbatore, Shivagange, Tiruchirappalli and Kasaragod will be able to see the “ring of fire”. However, residents of New Delhi, Pune, Jaipur, Lucknow, Kanpur, Nagpur, Indore, Kolkata, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Surat, Bhopal, Visakhapatnam, Ludhiana and Agra will only witness a partial solar eclipse. “From India, annular phase will be visible in the morning after sunrise from some places within a narrow corridor of southern part of the country (parts of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu) and it will be seen as partial solar eclipse from the rest part of the country. The narrow corridor of annular phase of the eclipse will pass through the southern part of the country through certain places like Kannur, Coimbatore, Kozhikode, Madurai, Mangalore, Ooty, Tiruchirappalli, etc,” a bulletin of the Positional Astronomy Centre stated.  Precautions while watching the solar eclipse “The eclipse should not be viewed with the naked eye. It will cause permanent damage of the eyes even when the moon covers most portion of the sun. Safe technique to observe the solar eclipse is either by using proper filter like aluminised Mylar, black polymer and welding glass of shade number 14 or by making projection of the sun’s image on a white board by a telescope,” the bulletin stated.  Dos and donts on solar eclipseExposing your eyes to the sun without proper eye protection during a solar eclipse can cause “eclipse blindness” or retinal burns, also known as solar retinopathy, say opthalmologists. "Radiation from the sun is so powerful that regular sunglasses or lens in cameras will not be able to filter," says senior opthalmologist Dr Mohan Rajan. "Looking at the sun for more than 90 seconds exceeds threshold of retinal damage," he said. The harmful ultra violet rays from the sun can destroy cells in the retina that transmit what you see to the brain, sometimes causing permanent damage. Many times people it can occur without pain. "Symptoms can take a few hours to a few days after viewing the solar eclipse to realize the damage that has occurred," he said. Many experience loss of central vision (solar retinopathy) , distorted vision or altered color vision. Do not watch the eclipse on * Smartphone * Camera viewfinder, telescope or binoculars * Unsafe filters or glasses. Dos Use specifically designed for viewing a solar eclipse. Follow directions to use carefully

NEW DELHI: Amid the furore over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the Union Cabinet on Tuesday   approved funds   to the tune of over Rs 8,500 crore for updating the National Population Register (NPR), officials have said. The NPR exercise is to commence from April next year. The NPR is a list of "usual residents" of the country. Updating of this data was done during 2015 by conducting door-to-door survey. The digitisation of the updated information has been completed. Meanwhile, the Left parties announced a seven-day nationwide protest from January 1 to 7 and a general strike on January 8 against the CAA, the NPR and the NRC. In a joint statement, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the Communist Party of India, the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist)-Liberation, the All India Forward Bloc and the Revolutionary Socialist Party said the protest programme was announced in solidarity with the trade unions, which have also called a general strike on January 8. Now it has been decided to update the National Population Register along with the house-listing phase of Census 2021 from April to September 2020 in all the states/union territories, except Assam.  What is NPR?The National Population Register (NPR) is a register of usual residents of the country being prepared at the local (village/sub-town), sub-district, district, state and national level under provisions of the Citizenship Act 1955 and the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003. It is mandatory for every usual resident of India to register in the NPR. Under the NPR, a usual resident is defined as a person who has resided in a local area for the past six months or more or a person who intends to reside in that area for the next six months or more. What is its purpose? NPR's purpose is to create a comprehensive identity database of every usual resident in the country. The database would contain demographic as well as biometric particulars. Aadhaar, mobile number, PAN, driving license, voter ID details and Indian passport numbers are among the details that will be collected from all usual residents of India. Sharing of Aadhaar is voluntary in view of the Supreme Court ruling in this regard. What are the demographic details required?Name of person Relationship to head of household, Father’s name, Mother’s name, Spouse’s name (if married), Sex, Date of Birth, Marital status, Place of birth, Nationality (as declared), Present address of usual residence, Duration of stay at present address, Permanent residential address, Occupation/Activity, Educational qualification. What is the current status? Data for NPR was collected in 2010 during collection of data for Census of India 2011. It was updated in 2015 through a door-to-door survey. The digitisation of the updated information has been completed. NPR data will now be updated along with the house-listing phase of Census 2021 from April-September 2020 in all states except Assam. A gazette notification to this effect has already been published by the central government. Which states have blocked NPR? The West Bengal government this month stayed all activities related to the preparation and updation of NPR. The decision came amid violent protests in parts of the state over CAA and chief minister Mamata Banerjee reiterating that the law and the proposed pan-India NRC will not be implemented in the state. Mamata Banerjee said, "All activities regarding the preparation and updation of the National Population Register are stayed in West Bengal. No activity regarding NRP may be taken up without clearance from the government of West Bengal." Kerala and Rajasthan have followed suit, saying they will not work on compiling the NPR as mandated by the Centre to record 'basic information' on citizens. "After considering the concerns raised in the wake of the 2019 amendment in the Citizenship Act, the state government has decided not to cooperate with the process to update the NPR to facilitate the preparation of the NRC," the office of Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said in a statement last week. Why is Assam excludedAs of now, the NPR exercise is not being undertaken in Assam. Assam recently had the NRC exercise undertaken to identify and detain illegal immigrants. The purpose of a pan-India NRC it to detect illegal immigrants and detain them, irrespective of faith, however there are concerns it could arbitrarily exclude genuine Indian citizens. How can NPR data be accessed NPR data will not be put in the public domain but will remain a secure database accessible to the relevant user through password protected protocols. The government says it will use the data to enhance the targeting of beneficiary-oriented schemes and will have implications on improving internal security.

NEW DELHI: Amid the protests across the country over the amended Citizenship Act, the government has said that there is no link between the new law and NRC. Home minister Amit Shah had earlier set a 2024 deadline for implementing the NRC across the country. Meanwhile, the Centre on Thursday clarified that the exercise to prepare an all-India National Register for Citizens — National Register of Indian Citizens (NRIC), as per the Citizenship Rules, 2003 — was yet to be notified and as and when it is done, rules and instructions would be framed in such a way that no Indian citizen is inconvenienced. Here is all you need to know about the NRC:  What is NRC (National Register of Citizens)?NRC means the National Register of Citizens. NRC is a list of Assam's residents – prepared to identify bonafide residents and deport illegal migrants in the northeastern state bordering Bangladesh. So far, this has been a state-specific exercise to keep its ethnic uniqueness unaltered.But ever since its implementation, there has been a growing demand for its nationwide implementation. Many top BJP leaders, including home minister Amit Shah have proposed that the NRC in Assam be implemented across India. It effectively suggests to bring a legislation that will enable the government to identify infiltrators who have been living in India illegally, detain them and finally deport them where they came from. Who stands to lose?The proposed Bill, which till now remains just a proposal, if implemented will target illegal immigrants in India. But Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhist, Jains and Parsis coming from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh won't be affected, if they claim they have arrived India after fleeing religious persecution. It essentially means, if a nationwide NRC is implemented as proposed, any illegal immigrant from other than Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, will be affected. And as for those three nations, people coming from there who belong to the Muslim community will also be affected as they are not included in the Citizenship Amendment Act. Who will be excluded?As proposed, if a nationwide NRC comes in place, the affected will be detained and taken to large detention centres, as it is happening in Assam. After that, the ministry of external affairs will get in touch with the concerned nations. If the details of the detained are matched and accepted by the concerned nations, deportations will follow. Assam is setting up detention centres exclusively for those declared foreigners after exhausting all legal routes. Repatriation of such people looks difficult as India and Bangladesh do not have any treaty in this regard at this point of time. The politics of NRCAmit Shah has been raising the pitch for a nationwide NRC for some time now. As late as this October, Shah raised the matter in West Bengal, not far from Assam. In Haryana, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar too made the promise of bringing the NRC in the state during his election campaigning. Even Mohan Bhagwat, the RSS supremo has been pitching for the same, though behind closed doors. Possibility of NRC in the rest of IndiaThe Centre has been pushing for NRCs in every state. Nagaland has already started an exercise to create a similar database of citizens known as the Register of Indigenous Inhabitants. The Centre has also announced plans for a National Population Register (NPR) which will contain demographic and bio-metric details of citizens. A pilot NPR project was launched when the UPA government was in power but was not completed.  What is NRC (National Register of Citizens)?NRC means the National Register of Citizens.

And as for those three nations, people coming from there who belong to the Muslim community will also be affected as they are not included in the Citizenship Amendment Act. Who will be excluded?As proposed, if a nationwide NRC comes in place, the affected will be detained and taken to large detention centres, as it is happening in Assam. After that, the ministry of external affairs will get in touch with the concerned nations. If the details of the detained are matched and accepted by the concerned nations, deportations will follow. Assam is setting up detention centres exclusively for those declared foreigners after exhausting all legal routes. Repatriation of such people looks difficult as India and Bangladesh do not have any treaty in this regard at this point of time. The politics of NRCAmit Shah has been raising the pitch for a nationwide NRC for some time now. As late as this October, Shah raised the matter in West Bengal, not far from Assam. In Haryana, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar too made the promise of bringing the NRC in the state during his election campaigning. Even Mohan Bhagwat, the RSS supremo has been pitching for the same, though behind closed doors. Possibility of NRC in the rest of IndiaThe Centre has been pushing for NRCs in every state. Nagaland has already started an exercise to create a similar database of citizens known as the Register of Indigenous Inhabitants. The Centre has also announced plans for a National Population Register (NPR) which will contain demographic and bio-metric details of citizens. A pilot NPR project was launched when the UPA government was in power but was not completed. (With agency inputs)

 What is Citizenship (Amendment) Bill?The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill seeks to provide Indian nationality to six communities — Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Parsis, Jains and Buddhists fleeing persecution from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.The bill amends the Citizenship Act, 1955 to make illegal migrants in the select categories eligible for citizenship. What does the government say:Home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday rejected the Opposition's charge that the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill was anti-Muslim, saying it does not take away the citizenship of any Indian Muslim and only seeks to given the same to persecuted minorities of three neighbouring countries. Replying to a debate on the bill in Rajya Sabha, he said the need to bring this Bill would not have arisen had Partition not taken place on the basis of religion. The Bill does not snatch citizenship of Muslims and their is no need for them to have any fear, he said. What does the opposition say:The legislation has been attacked by opposition parties, minority outfits and others for leaving out Muslims and also on the grounds that it is at odds with the Constitution, which does not differentiate between citizens on the basis of their faith. Who are the parties opposing/supporting the Bill?Congress, Trinamool, DMK, Samajwadi Party, RJD and Left, and even parties like Shiv Sena and BJD have expressed reservations. BJP's Assam ally AGP seemed to have warmed up to the idea of CAB after the government assured changes to the Bill. The government has the support of regional allies — Akali Dal and JD(U). AIADMK also voted in favour of the Bill in Rajya Sabha. Why are some northeast states opposing the Bill?The CAB has sparked resentment in the northeast as it is feared that granting citizenship to foreign refugees will undermine the ethnic communities living in these regions.There are indications that the government is working out a compromise. Formulations like provision of citizenship not leading to residency status in the smaller north-east states were discussed. Why has BJP's Assam-ally AGP taken a U-turn on CAB?In January last year, BJP's ally Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) had pulled out of NDA after Lok Sabha passed the earlier version of the Bill, which BJP had introduced in Parliament in 2016. When the Bill lapsed in the Lok Sabha, AGP returned to the alliance.Recently, the AGP has indicated a U-turn on the proposed Bill. “We have to move forward with the reality — neither can we expel lakhs of illegal migrants nor will Bangladesh ever take them back. We had our government twice in the past but we could not even identify the illegal migrants. Unfortunately, the Assam Accord has only gathered dust for over 34 years," AGP member and Assam minister Atul Bora said.

NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha on Monday passed Right to Information (Amendment) Bill, after division that allows the Central government to notify the term of office for the Chief Information Commissioner (CIC) and Information Commissioners (ICs) with the Opposition slamming the measure as diluting the provisions of the legislation. The Right to Information (Amendment) Bill, 2019 was passed with 218 members voting in its favour and 79 against it after a reply by Minister of state for personnel, public grievances and pensions, Jitendra Singh. The 2005 Act was enacted during the first Congress-led government UPA government. According to the activists, the efficacy of the RTI Act, allowing any Indian to seek information from any authority on the payment of Rs 10, hinges closely on the independence of the CIC and its equivalents in the states — state information commissions that adjudicate the matter in case information is not furnished to applicants within the parameters of the law. Here is explain: What’s changed in Parliament: While Lok Sabha was never a problem, the NDA’s weakling status in the Rajya Sabha prevented it from pushing several contentious bills — with its total strength in the Upper House less than that of the Opposition. However, that may not be a problem any longer as the NDA, along with some ‘friendly’ parties such as the TRS, YSRCP, BJD and others has a strength of 127 in the 245 member House of Elders, more than the halfway mark of 123. That should help it push through the bill after it passes in the Lok Sabha. What’s in the bill: The amended bill does away with the fixed tenure of five years for the Chief Information Commissioner (CIC) and the Information Commissioners (IC) — instead, they will serve for a tenure determined by the Central government. Moreover, the salary of the CIC and the ICs which are currently benchmarked with the salary of the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and the Election Commissioners respectively, which in turn are benchmarked with the salary of a Supreme Court judge, amount to Rs 2.50 lakh, along with a monthly allowance of Rs 34,000 per month — plus the usual perks like rent free furnished accommodation and 200 litres of fuel every month. The amended bill gives the government to fix the salary, which could be lower — given that the Information Commission is a statutory body unlike the EC which is a constitutional body. However, the current incumbents’ salaries will not be affected by the amendment. How will that affect RTI? Currently, the CIC and the IC are chosen by a three member panel of the PM, the Leader of Opposition or leader of the largest opposition party in Lok Sabha and a Cabinet minister nominated by the PM. Similarly, the State Chief Information Commissioners (SCIC) and State Information Commissioners (SIC) are chosen by a three member panel comprising the state CM, the state’s leader of opposition or leader of the largest opposition party in the state assembly and a state cabinet minister nominated the chief minister. The amended bill arrogates the power of appointment and the term as well as the salary of SCIC and SIC to the Central government — which nullifies the independence of the state legislatures. Even the CIC and the ICs will serve at the pleasure of the government — raising the possibility that they would be more interested in ensuring the longevity of their tenures rather than serving the citizens’ interests. Termination of terms? Current rules stipulate that no CIC, IC, SCIC or SIC serve more than one term, for a maximum period of 5 years or till the age of 65, whichever is earlier. For ICs and SICs, if one of them is nominated to the post of CIC or SCIC, his/her total tenure as both IC and CIC or SIC and SCIC can not exceed 5 years. While the new bill gives the government the power to fix tenures, it's not clear whether an incumbent seen as pliable or ‘friendly’ to the Centre may get to serve more than one term. Appointments & dismissals: If the tenure of the CIC, IC, SCIC and SIC are to be fixed by the Centre, it may follow that their removal from office may also be dependent on the Centre — whereas in the original bill, the CIC and IC may be removed only by the President — and the state Governor in case of SCIC and SIC — after an enquiry by the Supreme Court finds reason for their dismissal from office.

NEW DELHI: Indian and Chinese troops physically clashed once again in the high-altitude area of Naku La in north Sikkim last week, with several soldiers being injured on both sides after Indian troops repelled an attempt by Chinese troops to enter Indian territory. The Chinese actions served as a grim reminder of the assertiveness shown by the People’s Liberation Army all along the Line of Actual Control even as Indian Army remains in a state of high alertness to respond to aggressive actions. The Indian Army on Monday said it was a “minor face-off” at Naku La on January 20, which was “resolved by local commanders as per established protocols”. The action was, however, denied by Chinese government media mouthpiece Global Times which said no clash had occurred, claiming this was fake news. The brawl took place after Indian troops challenged a bid by the PLA to once again intrude into Indian territory at Naku La, which saw both sides rush reinforcements to the area. “Though no weapons were used during the incident, injuries were sustained on both sides. It was bigger than a routine scuffle. The situation is tense but under control,” a source said. Indian and Chinese troops had also clashed at Naku La on May 9 last year, which had left several soldiers on both sides injured, just after the violent clashes on the north bank of Pangong Tso in eastern Ladakh on May 5-6 after multiple PLA incursions into Indian territory. Later, a deadly physical clash at Galwan on June 15 night claimed 20 Indian lives and an unspecified number of Chinese soldiers died too. An Indian Army lieutenant had even punched a major from the PLA during the May 9 clash at Naku La, a sector located at an altitude of about 17,000 feet that has never been contested by China in the past. Though the troop face-off at Naku La had eased after some days, the eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation still continues at the ‘friction points’ in Pangong Tso, Chushul and Gogra-Hotsprings areas of eastern Ladakh. But what had come as a surprise was PLA’s aggressive behaviour in “new areas” like Naku La, which is located ahead of Muguthang in north Sikkim. Naku La has never figured in the 23 “disputed and sensitive areas” that have witnessed frequent transgressions and troop face-offs along the 3,488-km long LAC for years. Pangong Tso figures high on the list, with the other areas in Ladakh being Trig Heights, Demchok, Dumchele, Chumar and Spanggur Gap. In Arunachal, the flashpoints are Namkha Chu, Sumdorong Chu, Asaphila, Dichu, Yangtse and the so-called ‘Fish Tail-I and II’ areas in Dibang Valley. In the middle sector, the disputed areas include Barahoti, Kaurik and Shipki La.

The search-engine giant shared a beautiful creation for people to celebrate January 26, showcasing the diversity and range of vibrant cultures that bring this colorful nation to life. "I drew inspiration from the people of India—the culture, traditions, history, and architecture," Fondekar said. Republic Day honours the date January 26, 1950, as on this date, 72 years ago, the Constitution of India came into effect by replacing the Government of India act (1935). The country officially transits to a sovereign republic. A full size illustration of Google doodleOn this day, every nook and cranny of the country, including India's capital, is decorated with people enjoying their day off. While Republic Day only dates back to 1949, many subcontinent elements have been evolving for centuries. With origins that stretch back hundreds of years, musical instruments such as the dholak (a two-headed hand drum) and the sitar (a long-necked stringed instrument), both featured in the Doodle artwork, are just a few examples of India's rich heritage. From its distinctive architectural styles to the Bollywood film industry, India's cultural impact is felt globally, and today, there is much to celebrate. Happy Republic Day, India!

Bhawani Sharma, a nursing staff at Kanwatia Hospital in Jaipur, has been spending a lot of time these days doubling up as a self-styled counsellor. Sharma took the Covaxin jab on Saturday when the vaccination drive was rolled out across the country but found many of her colleagues hesitant to roll up their sleeves for a shot of the indigenously-developed Covaxin. “I have had no side effects,” Sharma has been going around telling others in her hospital. Five days into the nationwide drive — which saw the first phase being rolled out for healthcare workers in the frontline of Covid duty — and the dilemma whether to take the Covaxin jab has left beneficiaries in a fix. In none of the six cities, where Covaxin was made available, that TOI surveyed, did the percentage of healthcare workers going for the Covaxin shot reach 50%. Till Tuesday evening, Patna and Jaipur had clocked the highest of 49% while Mumbai and Delhi were at 31% and 33% respectively. Hospitals administering the vaccine have reported a higher percentage of beneficiaries taking the Covishield shot. “There is some hesitancy. We have seen some outright refusals too. However, what has equally contributed to the low acceptability are the glitches in the Co-Win application. We have not been able to intimate beneficiaries on time,” said Dr Lalit Sankhe, nodal officer for Covaxin at Mumbai’s JJ Hospital, the only centre in Mumbai with Covaxin. In Delhi, doctors have reported a “little higher hesitancy for Covaxin due to lack of efficacy data.” Covaxin is being administered in six central government-run hospitals in Delhi whereas Covishield is being given in all state-run and private hospitals. This has led to confusion and dissatisfaction among healthcare workers “Several doctors and PG students are not ready to take Covaxin as the third trial of this vaccine is in its initial stage. At least, the efficacy rate of Covishield is around 70% after its final trial,” said Dr Vinay Kumar, a senior resident at the AIIMS-Patna. In Pune, an official of the district hospital in Aundh said there was a general feeling among healthcare workers that they were being used as “guinea pigs”. “There are reports of anaphylactic reactions. I have decided to wait and I have also asked my junior doctors to wait,” said a senior gynecologist based in Chennai. (With inputs from Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Patna, Jaipur and Pune)

NEW DELHI: Former Japanese PM Shinzo Abe and late singer S P Balasubrahmanyam were conferred the Padma Vibhushan on Monday, while former Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan, Dalit leader and LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan, Tarun Gogoi and Keshubhai Patel (all three posthumously) and ex-principal secretary to the PM, Nripendra Misra, have been named for the Padma Bhushan. In a list which under the Modi government has shown a tilt towards "Bharat" or the grassroots, as many as 119 Padma awards — seven Padma Vibhushan, 10 Padma Bhushan and 102 Padma Shri — were announced. Among the awardees are 29 women and one transgender, while 10 are foreigners, NRIs, persons of Indian origin or overseas citizens of India. Sixteen awards have been conferred posthumously. "Dom Raja" of Varanasi, Jagdish Chaudhary, who had signed PM Narendra Modi’s nomination papers in the 2019 LS poll, was also posthumously awarded Padma Shri for social work. Apart from Abe, who shares a good equation with Modi and is seen as a prime architect of the Indo-Pacific strategy, other foreign nationals share a strong India connect. UK filmmaker Peter Brooks, who made the well-received film "Mahabharata" based on his nine-hour play, and the late Father Valles, a Spanish Jesuit priest who lived and worked in Gujarat, have been honoured with Padma Shri. No Bharat Ratna was announced this year as well. The focus on low-profile achievers was best reflected in the selection of recipients from the art, culture and medicine categories, with many recipients hailing from the hinterland. The choice of the late Congress leader Gogoi, former CM of poll-bound Assam, is significant and will strike many as a shrewd move. B B Lal is another interesting pick in the Padma Vibhushan list. The reputed archaeologist was head of the ASI during an excavation in Ayodhya that was seen as yielding evidence of a Hindu temple — a determination which saw him being criticised by left historians but which strengthened VHP’s case for construction of a Ram Mandir at the disputed site. Three from the Sangh Parivar — former Gujarat CM Keshubhai Patel, Sumitra Mahajan and former governor Mridula Sinha, who passed away recently — too made the cut. The maximum 11 awards went to people from Tamil Nadu, incidentally another state headed for the polls. The Padma Vibhushan list included Puri-based sculptor Sudarshan Sahoo, cardiologist and Manipal University ex-chancellor B M Hegde, Islamic scholar Maulana Wahiduddin Khan and Indian-American Sikh physicist Narinder Singh Kapany, known for his work in the field of fibre optics. Playback singer K S Chithra was given the Padma Bhushan. Rattan Lal was awarded Padma Shri for regenerative agriculture. Pappammal from Coimbatore, who runs her own organic farm, was conferred Padma Shri. The 10 Padma Bhushan awardees include Islamic spiritual leader Kalbe Sadiq (posthumous), former MP and ex-chairman of National Commission for Minorities Tarlochan Singh, who has worked for the Sikh community, Kannada poet and playwright Chandrashekhar Kambara, and Maharashtra-based industrialist Rajnikant Devidas Shroff. In the Padma Shri list are former Union minister from Assam Bijoya Chakravarty. Among sportspersons in the Padma Shri list are basketball player P Anitha, table tennis player Mouma Das, athlete Sudha Hari Narayan Singh, para-sportsman K Y Venkatesh, wrestler Virender Singh and mountaineer Anshu Jamsenpa. The list, like the past few years, includes many unsung heroes in fields like art, social work, agriculture and also in a new category — grassroots innovation. From the field of trade and industry, Punjab-based Cremica founder Rajni Bector, late P Subramanian of Shanthi Gears based in Coimbatore who was also a philanthropist, and Zoho Corporation CEO Sridhar Vembu, have been conferred Padma Shri. Greek Indologist Nicholas Kazanas was awarded Padma Shri in the "literature and education" category, the former posthumously.

NEW DELHI: The Centre has asked all states and Union Territories to tighten security during Tuesday's 'Bharat Bandh' called by the farmers unions and supported by opposition parties, while asserting that peace and tranquillity must be maintained on that day, officials said. In a countrywide advisory, the Union Home Ministry also said the state governments and UT administrations must ensure that the Covid-19 guidelines issued with regard to health and social distancing are strictly followed. The 'Bharat Bandh' has been called by the farmers unions who have been protesting the three farm laws enacted in the Monsoon Session of Parliament. Major political parties on Sunday came out in strong support of the bandh. Here is all you want to know about new farm laws.  Key provisions of the lawsThe key provisions of new farm laws are intended to help small and marginal farmers (86% of total farmers) who don’t have means to either bargain for their produce to get a better price or invest in technology to improve the productivity of farms. The Act on Agri market allows farmers to sell their produce outside APMC ‘mandis’ to whoever they want. Anyone can buy their produce even at their farm gates. Though ‘commission agents’ of the ‘mandis’ and states could lose 'commissions' and 'mandi fees' respectively (the main reasons for the current protests), farmers will get better prices through competition and cost-cutting on transportation.The law on contract farming will, on the other hand, allow farmers to enter into a contract with agri-business firms or large retailers on pre-agreed prices of their produce. This will help small and marginal farmers as the legislation will transfer the risk of market unpredictability from the farmer to the sponsor. The third law seeks to remove commodities like cereals, pulses, oilseeds, edible oils, onion and potatoes from the list of essential commodities. This provision will attract private sector/foreign direct investment into the agriculture sector.  What farmers fear:Farmer unions in Punjab and Haryana say the recent laws enacted at the Centre will dismantle the minimum support price (MSP) system. Over time big corporate houses will dictate terms and farmers will end up getting less for their crops, they argue. Farmers fear that with the virtual disbanding of the mandi system, they will not get an assured price for their crops and the “arthiyas” -- commission agents who also pitch in with loans for them -- will be out of business. Farmers demands:The key demand is the withdrawal of the three laws which deregulate the sale of their crops. The farmer unions could also settle for a legal assurance that the MSP system will continue, ideally through an amendment to the laws.They are also pressing for the withdrawal of the proposed Electricity (Amendment) Bill 2020, fearing it will lead to an end to subsidised electricity. Farmers say rules against stubble burning should also not apply to them. How MSP affects farmersMSP is the minimum price paid by the government when it procures any crop from the farmers. It is announced by the state-run Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) for more than 22 commodities on an annual basis, after calculating the cost of cultivation. Food Corporation of India (FCI) -- which is the main state-run grain procurement agency -- largely buys only paddy and wheat at these prices. The FCI then sells these foodgrains at highly subsidised prices to the poor and is thereafter compensated by the government for its losses. What the government saysThe three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. Until 2020, the first sale of agriculture produce could occur only at the mandis of the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC). However, after the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 came into force it allows farmers to sell outside APMC mandis in India.

Hospitals and health centres across several cities and towns in many states and UTs could not achieve their Covid-19 vaccination targets on Tuesday thanks to continuing hesitancy among health workers in taking the shot, with a section of doctors in hospitals in Hyderabad even writing letters to their superiors, saying they would rather wait for more options before they take a jab. Reports of several cases of adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) were among the factors which caused health workers to skip the inoculations despite their names listed at the centres. “There’re cases of adverse effects being reported for the available vaccines and one is still under trial,” read a letter by a senior resident at Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (TIMS) in Hyderabad, referring to Covaxin. “I prefer to wait until there is a better vaccine available,” the doctor said in the letter. As many as 67 health workers at TIMS refused to take the jab on Tuesday. “If I take the vaccine now, I will not be able to take another vaccine in the near future, which might have better efficacy,” wrote a senior doctor from Osmania General Hospital, where less than 200 out of the 600 beneficiaries listed took the vaccine Scores of health workers skipped inoculation in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad in Maharashtra because of hesitancy. The deputy director for health services, Sanjay Deshmukh, said the refusals were due to anxiety over safety and efficacy of the vaccines. In Nagpur’s Government Medical College and Hospital, the exclusive centre for Covaxin in the city, only 29 out of 100 beneficiaries took the jab on Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: Amidst protest from opposition and a section of farmer's organisations, the Monsoon Session of the Lok Sabha passed three agriculture sector bills which will replace the existing ordinances once they are passed by the Rajya Sabha also. On Thursday, SAD leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal resigned from the Union council of ministers protesting against the bills which she said are anti-farmer and will destroy the agriculture sector in Punjab. Here is all you need to know about the three bills: 1. Bill on agri marketFarmer's Produce Trade and Commerce(Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020Provisions* To create an ecosystem where farmers and traders enjoy the freedom to sell and purchase farm produce outide registered 'mandis' under states' APMCs. * To promote barrier-free inter-state and intra-state trade of farmers' produce * To reduce marketing/transportation costs and help farmers in getting better prices * To provide a facilitative framework for electronic trading Opposition* States will lose revenue as they won't be able to collect 'mandi fees' if farmers sell their produce outside registered APMC markets. * What happens to 'commission agents' in states if entire farm trade moves out of mandis? * It may eventually end the MSP-based procurement system. * Electronic trading like in e-NAM uses physical 'mandi' structure. What will happen to e-NAM if 'mandis' are destroyed in absence of trading? New farm bill 2020: Who is protesting &amp; why2. Bill on contract farmingThe Farmer (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020Provisions* Farmers can enter into a contract with agribusiness firms, processors, wholesalers, exporters or large retailers for sale of future farming produce at a pre-agreed price * Marginal and small farmers, with land less than five hectares, to gain via aggregation and contract (Marginal and small farmers account for 86% of total farmers in India) * To transfer the risk of market unpredictability from farmers to sponsors * To enable farmers to access modern tech and get better inputs * To reduce cost of marketing and boost farmer's income. * Farmers can engage in direct marketing by eliminating intermediaries for full price realisation * Effective dispute resolution mechanism with redressal timelines. Opposition* Farmers in contract farming arrangements will be the weaker players in terms of their ability to negotiate what they need * The sponsors may not like to deal with a multitude of small and marginal farmers * Being big private companies, exporters, wholesalers and processors, the sponsors will have an edge in disputes. 3. Bill relating to commoditiesThe Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020Provisions* To remove commodities like cereals, pulses, oilseeds, onion and potatoes from the list of essential commodities. It will do away with the imposition of stockholding limits on such items except under "extraordinary circumstances" like war * This provision will attract private sector/FDI into farm sector as it will remove fears of private investors of excessive regulatory interference in business operations. * To bring investment for farm infrastructure like cold storages, and modernising food supply chain. * To help both farmers and consumers by bringing in price stability. * To create competitive market environment and cut wastage of farm produce. Opposition* Price limits for "extraordinary circumstances" are so high that they are likely to be never triggered. * Big companies will have the freedom to stock commodities- it means they will dictate terms to farmers which may lead to less prices for the cultivators. * Recent decision on export ban on onion creates doubt on its implementation.

NEW DELHI: The novel coronavirus is now spreading much more rapidly outside China than within the country, leading the world into uncharted territory, but the outbreak can still be contained, the World Health Organization said on Monday. The virus has so far claimed over 3,000 lives and there are over 90,000 confirmed cases.  What is coronavirus?Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. What are zoonotic?Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. What are the signs of infections?Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, the infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. How to prevent infection from spreading?Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Stay home when you are sick. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. Who should wear a facemask?It is not necessary for people who are well to wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases. Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others, Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said. What is the treatment for novel coronavirus?There is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for COVID-19. People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. For severe cases, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions. People who think they may have been exposed to COVID-19 should contact their healthcare provider immediately. Here is a list of dos and don'ts issued by the government to stall the spread of the virus in the country —Do's Cover your nose and mouth with disposable tissue or handkerchief Frequently wash your hands with soap and water Avoid crowded places Person suffering from Influenza like illness must be confined at home Stay more than one arm's length distance from persons sick with flu Take adequate sleep and rest Drink plenty of water/liquids and eat nutritious food Person suspected with Influenza like illness must consult doctor Don'ts Touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands while coughing or sneezing Hugging, kissing and shaking hands while greeting Spitting in public places Taking medicines without consulting doctor Disposal of used napkin or tissue paper in open areas Touching surfaces usually used by public (railing, door, gates, etc)

What is solar eclipse and how does it occur?

NEW DELHI: Several parts of the country, including Odisha, Kerala, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Delhi, are witnessing a solar eclipse on Thursday morning, which is said to the last one of the decade. The solar eclipse, which occurs when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun, began at around 8:17 am and will continue till 10:57 am today. It is also being referred to as "ring of fire" and "Surya Grahan" in Hindi. The beginning of the eclipse can be first seen from the Arabian sea coast of Oman at around 7:59 hours IST and the annular eclipse will become first visible in west of Baharain at 09:06 hours IST, Duari added. Here is all you want to know about solar eclipse.  What is a solar eclipse? A solar eclipse occurs when a portion of the Earth is engulfed in a shadow cast by the Moon which fully or partially blocks sunlight. This occurs when the Sun, Moon and Earth are aligned. Such alignment coincides with a new moon indicating the Moon is closest to the ecliptic plane. In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is obscured. If the Moon were in a perfectly circular orbit, a little closer to the Earth, and in the same orbital plane, there would be total solar eclipses every new moon. However, since the Moon's orbit is tilted at more than 5 degrees to the Earth's orbit around the Sun, its shadow usually misses Earth. A solar eclipse can only occur when the Moon is close enough to the ecliptic plane during a new moon. What is a ‘Ring of Fire’ during solar eclipse?We do not get to see a ‘Ring of Fire’ during all solar eclipses and those solar eclipses where a ‘Ring of Fire’ is visible is called an annular solar eclipse. During such an eclipse, the centre of the Sun is covered by the Moon in such a way that the outer edge of the Sun is left visible and it looks like a ring. When viewed from a long distance it looks like a ring of fire around the Moon called the 'annulus'. However, when an annular solar eclipse takes place, the ‘Ring of Fire’ is not visible from all places on earth. As a result of which the annular solar eclipse may look like a partial solar eclipse. When does an annular solar eclipse happen? We do not get to see a 'ring of fire' during all solar eclipse. For an annular solar eclipse to take place, three things need to happen — there should be a New Moon, the Moon should be at or very near a lunar node so that the Sun, Moon and the Earth all are in a straight line and the Moon should be near the apogee (the farthest point of the Moon from Earth) so that the outer edge of the Sun is visible. The 'Ring of Fire' is visible only when all these three parameters are met. When will solar eclipse start on Wednesday According to the India Meteorological Department’s Kolkata-based Positional Astronomy Centre, the solar eclipse will begin at 8am on Thursday. It will slowly increase in intensity before peaking two hours later. It will end at 1.35pm. Places where solar eclipse can be seen In Delhi, the partial eclipse will begin at 8.17am while the greatest eclipse will start at 9.30. The partial eclipse will end at 10.56am and the total duration of the eclipse will be 2 hours and 39 minutes. The solar eclipse will be at its maximum intensity at 10.47am and will remain so for a little under four minutes. The eclipse will be visible in some parts of India, Sri Lanka, UAE, Sumatra, Australia, Philippines and Singapore. People living in Ooty, Mangalore, Coimbatore, Shivagange, Tiruchirappalli and Kasaragod will be able to see the “ring of fire”. However, residents of New Delhi, Pune, Jaipur, Lucknow, Kanpur, Nagpur, Indore, Kolkata, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Surat, Bhopal, Visakhapatnam, Ludhiana and Agra will only witness a partial solar eclipse. “From India, annular phase will be visible in the morning after sunrise from some places within a narrow corridor of southern part of the country (parts of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu) and it will be seen as partial solar eclipse from the rest part of the country. The narrow corridor of annular phase of the eclipse will pass through the southern part of the country through certain places like Kannur, Coimbatore, Kozhikode, Madurai, Mangalore, Ooty, Tiruchirappalli, etc,” a bulletin of the Positional Astronomy Centre stated.  Precautions while watching the solar eclipse “The eclipse should not be viewed with the naked eye. It will cause permanent damage of the eyes even when the moon covers most portion of the sun. Safe technique to observe the solar eclipse is either by using proper filter like aluminised Mylar, black polymer and welding glass of shade number 14 or by making projection of the sun’s image on a white board by a telescope,” the bulletin stated.  Dos and donts on solar eclipseExposing your eyes to the sun without proper eye protection during a solar eclipse can cause “eclipse blindness” or retinal burns, also known as solar retinopathy, say opthalmologists. "Radiation from the sun is so powerful that regular sunglasses or lens in cameras will not be able to filter," says senior opthalmologist Dr Mohan Rajan. "Looking at the sun for more than 90 seconds exceeds threshold of retinal damage," he said. The harmful ultra violet rays from the sun can destroy cells in the retina that transmit what you see to the brain, sometimes causing permanent damage. Many times people it can occur without pain. "Symptoms can take a few hours to a few days after viewing the solar eclipse to realize the damage that has occurred," he said. Many experience loss of central vision (solar retinopathy) , distorted vision or altered color vision. Do not watch the eclipse on * Smartphone * Camera viewfinder, telescope or binoculars * Unsafe filters or glasses. Dos Use specifically designed for viewing a solar eclipse. Follow directions to use carefully

NEW DELHI: Amid the furore over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the Union Cabinet on Tuesday   approved funds   to the tune of over Rs 8,500 crore for updating the National Population Register (NPR), officials have said. The NPR exercise is to commence from April next year. The NPR is a list of "usual residents" of the country. Updating of this data was done during 2015 by conducting door-to-door survey. The digitisation of the updated information has been completed. Meanwhile, the Left parties announced a seven-day nationwide protest from January 1 to 7 and a general strike on January 8 against the CAA, the NPR and the NRC. In a joint statement, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the Communist Party of India, the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist)-Liberation, the All India Forward Bloc and the Revolutionary Socialist Party said the protest programme was announced in solidarity with the trade unions, which have also called a general strike on January 8. Now it has been decided to update the National Population Register along with the house-listing phase of Census 2021 from April to September 2020 in all the states/union territories, except Assam.  What is NPR?The National Population Register (NPR) is a register of usual residents of the country being prepared at the local (village/sub-town), sub-district, district, state and national level under provisions of the Citizenship Act 1955 and the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003. It is mandatory for every usual resident of India to register in the NPR. Under the NPR, a usual resident is defined as a person who has resided in a local area for the past six months or more or a person who intends to reside in that area for the next six months or more. What is its purpose? NPR's purpose is to create a comprehensive identity database of every usual resident in the country. The database would contain demographic as well as biometric particulars. Aadhaar, mobile number, PAN, driving license, voter ID details and Indian passport numbers are among the details that will be collected from all usual residents of India. Sharing of Aadhaar is voluntary in view of the Supreme Court ruling in this regard. What are the demographic details required?Name of person Relationship to head of household, Father’s name, Mother’s name, Spouse’s name (if married), Sex, Date of Birth, Marital status, Place of birth, Nationality (as declared), Present address of usual residence, Duration of stay at present address, Permanent residential address, Occupation/Activity, Educational qualification. What is the current status? Data for NPR was collected in 2010 during collection of data for Census of India 2011. It was updated in 2015 through a door-to-door survey. The digitisation of the updated information has been completed. NPR data will now be updated along with the house-listing phase of Census 2021 from April-September 2020 in all states except Assam. A gazette notification to this effect has already been published by the central government. Which states have blocked NPR? The West Bengal government this month stayed all activities related to the preparation and updation of NPR. The decision came amid violent protests in parts of the state over CAA and chief minister Mamata Banerjee reiterating that the law and the proposed pan-India NRC will not be implemented in the state. Mamata Banerjee said, "All activities regarding the preparation and updation of the National Population Register are stayed in West Bengal. No activity regarding NRP may be taken up without clearance from the government of West Bengal." Kerala and Rajasthan have followed suit, saying they will not work on compiling the NPR as mandated by the Centre to record 'basic information' on citizens. "After considering the concerns raised in the wake of the 2019 amendment in the Citizenship Act, the state government has decided not to cooperate with the process to update the NPR to facilitate the preparation of the NRC," the office of Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said in a statement last week. Why is Assam excludedAs of now, the NPR exercise is not being undertaken in Assam. Assam recently had the NRC exercise undertaken to identify and detain illegal immigrants. The purpose of a pan-India NRC it to detect illegal immigrants and detain them, irrespective of faith, however there are concerns it could arbitrarily exclude genuine Indian citizens. How can NPR data be accessed NPR data will not be put in the public domain but will remain a secure database accessible to the relevant user through password protected protocols. The government says it will use the data to enhance the targeting of beneficiary-oriented schemes and will have implications on improving internal security.

NEW DELHI: Amid the protests across the country over the amended Citizenship Act, the government has said that there is no link between the new law and NRC. Home minister Amit Shah had earlier set a 2024 deadline for implementing the NRC across the country. Meanwhile, the Centre on Thursday clarified that the exercise to prepare an all-India National Register for Citizens — National Register of Indian Citizens (NRIC), as per the Citizenship Rules, 2003 — was yet to be notified and as and when it is done, rules and instructions would be framed in such a way that no Indian citizen is inconvenienced. Here is all you need to know about the NRC:  What is NRC (National Register of Citizens)?NRC means the National Register of Citizens. NRC is a list of Assam's residents – prepared to identify bonafide residents and deport illegal migrants in the northeastern state bordering Bangladesh. So far, this has been a state-specific exercise to keep its ethnic uniqueness unaltered.But ever since its implementation, there has been a growing demand for its nationwide implementation. Many top BJP leaders, including home minister Amit Shah have proposed that the NRC in Assam be implemented across India. It effectively suggests to bring a legislation that will enable the government to identify infiltrators who have been living in India illegally, detain them and finally deport them where they came from. Who stands to lose?The proposed Bill, which till now remains just a proposal, if implemented will target illegal immigrants in India. But Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhist, Jains and Parsis coming from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh won't be affected, if they claim they have arrived India after fleeing religious persecution. It essentially means, if a nationwide NRC is implemented as proposed, any illegal immigrant from other than Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, will be affected. And as for those three nations, people coming from there who belong to the Muslim community will also be affected as they are not included in the Citizenship Amendment Act. Who will be excluded?As proposed, if a nationwide NRC comes in place, the affected will be detained and taken to large detention centres, as it is happening in Assam. After that, the ministry of external affairs will get in touch with the concerned nations. If the details of the detained are matched and accepted by the concerned nations, deportations will follow. Assam is setting up detention centres exclusively for those declared foreigners after exhausting all legal routes. Repatriation of such people looks difficult as India and Bangladesh do not have any treaty in this regard at this point of time. The politics of NRCAmit Shah has been raising the pitch for a nationwide NRC for some time now. As late as this October, Shah raised the matter in West Bengal, not far from Assam. In Haryana, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar too made the promise of bringing the NRC in the state during his election campaigning. Even Mohan Bhagwat, the RSS supremo has been pitching for the same, though behind closed doors. Possibility of NRC in the rest of IndiaThe Centre has been pushing for NRCs in every state. Nagaland has already started an exercise to create a similar database of citizens known as the Register of Indigenous Inhabitants. The Centre has also announced plans for a National Population Register (NPR) which will contain demographic and bio-metric details of citizens. A pilot NPR project was launched when the UPA government was in power but was not completed.  What is NRC (National Register of Citizens)?NRC means the National Register of Citizens.

 What is Citizenship (Amendment) Bill?The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill seeks to provide Indian nationality to six communities — Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Parsis, Jains and Buddhists fleeing persecution from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.The bill amends the Citizenship Act, 1955 to make illegal migrants in the select categories eligible for citizenship. What does the government say:Home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday rejected the Opposition's charge that the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill was anti-Muslim, saying it does not take away the citizenship of any Indian Muslim and only seeks to given the same to persecuted minorities of three neighbouring countries. Replying to a debate on the bill in Rajya Sabha, he said the need to bring this Bill would not have arisen had Partition not taken place on the basis of religion. The Bill does not snatch citizenship of Muslims and their is no need for them to have any fear, he said. What does the opposition say:The legislation has been attacked by opposition parties, minority outfits and others for leaving out Muslims and also on the grounds that it is at odds with the Constitution, which does not differentiate between citizens on the basis of their faith. Who are the parties opposing/supporting the Bill?Congress, Trinamool, DMK, Samajwadi Party, RJD and Left, and even parties like Shiv Sena and BJD have expressed reservations. BJP's Assam ally AGP seemed to have warmed up to the idea of CAB after the government assured changes to the Bill. The government has the support of regional allies — Akali Dal and JD(U). AIADMK also voted in favour of the Bill in Rajya Sabha. Why are some northeast states opposing the Bill?The CAB has sparked resentment in the northeast as it is feared that granting citizenship to foreign refugees will undermine the ethnic communities living in these regions.There are indications that the government is working out a compromise. Formulations like provision of citizenship not leading to residency status in the smaller north-east states were discussed. Why has BJP's Assam-ally AGP taken a U-turn on CAB?In January last year, BJP's ally Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) had pulled out of NDA after Lok Sabha passed the earlier version of the Bill, which BJP had introduced in Parliament in 2016. When the Bill lapsed in the Lok Sabha, AGP returned to the alliance.Recently, the AGP has indicated a U-turn on the proposed Bill. “We have to move forward with the reality — neither can we expel lakhs of illegal migrants nor will Bangladesh ever take them back. We had our government twice in the past but we could not even identify the illegal migrants. Unfortunately, the Assam Accord has only gathered dust for over 34 years," AGP member and Assam minister Atul Bora said.

NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha on Monday passed Right to Information (Amendment) Bill, after division that allows the Central government to notify the term of office for the Chief Information Commissioner (CIC) and Information Commissioners (ICs) with the Opposition slamming the measure as diluting the provisions of the legislation. The Right to Information (Amendment) Bill, 2019 was passed with 218 members voting in its favour and 79 against it after a reply by Minister of state for personnel, public grievances and pensions, Jitendra Singh. The 2005 Act was enacted during the first Congress-led government UPA government. According to the activists, the efficacy of the RTI Act, allowing any Indian to seek information from any authority on the payment of Rs 10, hinges closely on the independence of the CIC and its equivalents in the states — state information commissions that adjudicate the matter in case information is not furnished to applicants within the parameters of the law. Here is explain: What’s changed in Parliament: While Lok Sabha was never a problem, the NDA’s weakling status in the Rajya Sabha prevented it from pushing several contentious bills — with its total strength in the Upper House less than that of the Opposition. However, that may not be a problem any longer as the NDA, along with some ‘friendly’ parties such as the TRS, YSRCP, BJD and others has a strength of 127 in the 245 member House of Elders, more than the halfway mark of 123. That should help it push through the bill after it passes in the Lok Sabha. What’s in the bill: The amended bill does away with the fixed tenure of five years for the Chief Information Commissioner (CIC) and the Information Commissioners (IC) — instead, they will serve for a tenure determined by the Central government. Moreover, the salary of the CIC and the ICs which are currently benchmarked with the salary of the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and the Election Commissioners respectively, which in turn are benchmarked with the salary of a Supreme Court judge, amount to Rs 2.50 lakh, along with a monthly allowance of Rs 34,000 per month — plus the usual perks like rent free furnished accommodation and 200 litres of fuel every month. The amended bill gives the government to fix the salary, which could be lower — given that the Information Commission is a statutory body unlike the EC which is a constitutional body. However, the current incumbents’ salaries will not be affected by the amendment. How will that affect RTI? Currently, the CIC and the IC are chosen by a three member panel of the PM, the Leader of Opposition or leader of the largest opposition party in Lok Sabha and a Cabinet minister nominated by the PM. Similarly, the State Chief Information Commissioners (SCIC) and State Information Commissioners (SIC) are chosen by a three member panel comprising the state CM, the state’s leader of opposition or leader of the largest opposition party in the state assembly and a state cabinet minister nominated the chief minister. The amended bill arrogates the power of appointment and the term as well as the salary of SCIC and SIC to the Central government — which nullifies the independence of the state legislatures. Even the CIC and the ICs will serve at the pleasure of the government — raising the possibility that they would be more interested in ensuring the longevity of their tenures rather than serving the citizens’ interests. Termination of terms? Current rules stipulate that no CIC, IC, SCIC or SIC serve more than one term, for a maximum period of 5 years or till the age of 65, whichever is earlier. For ICs and SICs, if one of them is nominated to the post of CIC or SCIC, his/her total tenure as both IC and CIC or SIC and SCIC can not exceed 5 years. While the new bill gives the government the power to fix tenures, it's not clear whether an incumbent seen as pliable or ‘friendly’ to the Centre may get to serve more than one term. Appointments & dismissals: If the tenure of the CIC, IC, SCIC and SIC are to be fixed by the Centre, it may follow that their removal from office may also be dependent on the Centre — whereas in the original bill, the CIC and IC may be removed only by the President — and the state Governor in case of SCIC and SIC — after an enquiry by the Supreme Court finds reason for their dismissal from office.

NEW DELHI: Indian and Chinese troops physically clashed once again in the high-altitude area of Naku La in north Sikkim last week, with several soldiers being injured on both sides after Indian troops repelled an attempt by Chinese troops to enter Indian territory. The Chinese actions served as a grim reminder of the assertiveness shown by the People’s Liberation Army all along the Line of Actual Control even as Indian Army remains in a state of high alertness to respond to aggressive actions. The Indian Army on Monday said it was a “minor face-off” at Naku La on January 20, which was “resolved by local commanders as per established protocols”. The action was, however, denied by Chinese government media mouthpiece Global Times which said no clash had occurred, claiming this was fake news. The brawl took place after Indian troops challenged a bid by the PLA to once again intrude into Indian territory at Naku La, which saw both sides rush reinforcements to the area. “Though no weapons were used during the incident, injuries were sustained on both sides. It was bigger than a routine scuffle. The situation is tense but under control,” a source said. Indian and Chinese troops had also clashed at Naku La on May 9 last year, which had left several soldiers on both sides injured, just after the violent clashes on the north bank of Pangong Tso in eastern Ladakh on May 5-6 after multiple PLA incursions into Indian territory. Later, a deadly physical clash at Galwan on June 15 night claimed 20 Indian lives and an unspecified number of Chinese soldiers died too. An Indian Army lieutenant had even punched a major from the PLA during the May 9 clash at Naku La, a sector located at an altitude of about 17,000 feet that has never been contested by China in the past. Though the troop face-off at Naku La had eased after some days, the eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation still continues at the ‘friction points’ in Pangong Tso, Chushul and Gogra-Hotsprings areas of eastern Ladakh. But what had come as a surprise was PLA’s aggressive behaviour in “new areas” like Naku La, which is located ahead of Muguthang in north Sikkim. Naku La has never figured in the 23 “disputed and sensitive areas” that have witnessed frequent transgressions and troop face-offs along the 3,488-km long LAC for years. Pangong Tso figures high on the list, with the other areas in Ladakh being Trig Heights, Demchok, Dumchele, Chumar and Spanggur Gap. In Arunachal, the flashpoints are Namkha Chu, Sumdorong Chu, Asaphila, Dichu, Yangtse and the so-called ‘Fish Tail-I and II’ areas in Dibang Valley. In the middle sector, the disputed areas include Barahoti, Kaurik and Shipki La.

NEW DELHI: As India observes its 72nd Republic Day today, Google marked the occasion with a creative doodle illustrated by Mumbai-based guest artist Onkar Fondekar. The search-engine giant shared a beautiful creation for people to celebrate January 26, showcasing the diversity and range of vibrant cultures that bring this colorful nation to life. "I drew inspiration from the people of India—the culture, traditions, history, and architecture," Fondekar said. Republic Day honours the date January 26, 1950, as on this date, 72 years ago, the Constitution of India came into effect by replacing the Government of India act (1935). The country officially transits to a sovereign republic. A full size illustration of Google doodleOn this day, every nook and cranny of the country, including India's capital, is decorated with people enjoying their day off. While Republic Day only dates back to 1949, many subcontinent elements have been evolving for centuries. With origins that stretch back hundreds of years, musical instruments such as the dholak (a two-headed hand drum) and the sitar (a long-necked stringed instrument), both featured in the Doodle artwork, are just a few examples of India's rich heritage. From its distinctive architectural styles to the Bollywood film industry, India's cultural impact is felt globally, and today, there is much to celebrate. Happy Republic Day, India!

Bhawani Sharma, a nursing staff at Kanwatia Hospital in Jaipur, has been spending a lot of time these days doubling up as a self-styled counsellor. Sharma took the Covaxin jab on Saturday when the vaccination drive was rolled out across the country but found many of her colleagues hesitant to roll up their sleeves for a shot of the indigenously-developed Covaxin. “I have had no side effects,” Sharma has been going around telling others in her hospital. Five days into the nationwide drive — which saw the first phase being rolled out for healthcare workers in the frontline of Covid duty — and the dilemma whether to take the Covaxin jab has left beneficiaries in a fix. In none of the six cities, where Covaxin was made available, that TOI surveyed, did the percentage of healthcare workers going for the Covaxin shot reach 50%. Till Tuesday evening, Patna and Jaipur had clocked the highest of 49% while Mumbai and Delhi were at 31% and 33% respectively. Hospitals administering the vaccine have reported a higher percentage of beneficiaries taking the Covishield shot. “There is some hesitancy. We have seen some outright refusals too. However, what has equally contributed to the low acceptability are the glitches in the Co-Win application. We have not been able to intimate beneficiaries on time,” said Dr Lalit Sankhe, nodal officer for Covaxin at Mumbai’s JJ Hospital, the only centre in Mumbai with Covaxin. In Delhi, doctors have reported a “little higher hesitancy for Covaxin due to lack of efficacy data.” Covaxin is being administered in six central government-run hospitals in Delhi whereas Covishield is being given in all state-run and private hospitals. This has led to confusion and dissatisfaction among healthcare workers “Several doctors and PG students are not ready to take Covaxin as the third trial of this vaccine is in its initial stage. At least, the efficacy rate of Covishield is around 70% after its final trial,” said Dr Vinay Kumar, a senior resident at the AIIMS-Patna. In Pune, an official of the district hospital in Aundh said there was a general feeling among healthcare workers that they were being used as “guinea pigs”. “There are reports of anaphylactic reactions. I have decided to wait and I have also asked my junior doctors to wait,” said a senior gynecologist based in Chennai. (With inputs from Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Patna, Jaipur and Pune)

NEW DELHI: Former Japanese PM Shinzo Abe and late singer S P Balasubrahmanyam were conferred the Padma Vibhushan on Monday, while former Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan, Dalit leader and LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan, Tarun Gogoi and Keshubhai Patel (all three posthumously) and ex-principal secretary to the PM, Nripendra Misra, have been named for the Padma Bhushan. In a list which under the Modi government has shown a tilt towards "Bharat" or the grassroots, as many as 119 Padma awards — seven Padma Vibhushan, 10 Padma Bhushan and 102 Padma Shri — were announced. Among the awardees are 29 women and one transgender, while 10 are foreigners, NRIs, persons of Indian origin or overseas citizens of India. Sixteen awards have been conferred posthumously. "Dom Raja" of Varanasi, Jagdish Chaudhary, who had signed PM Narendra Modi’s nomination papers in the 2019 LS poll, was also posthumously awarded Padma Shri for social work. Apart from Abe, who shares a good equation with Modi and is seen as a prime architect of the Indo-Pacific strategy, other foreign nationals share a strong India connect. UK filmmaker Peter Brooks, who made the well-received film "Mahabharata" based on his nine-hour play, and the late Father Valles, a Spanish Jesuit priest who lived and worked in Gujarat, have been honoured with Padma Shri. No Bharat Ratna was announced this year as well. The focus on low-profile achievers was best reflected in the selection of recipients from the art, culture and medicine categories, with many recipients hailing from the hinterland. The choice of the late Congress leader Gogoi, former CM of poll-bound Assam, is significant and will strike many as a shrewd move. B B Lal is another interesting pick in the Padma Vibhushan list. The reputed archaeologist was head of the ASI during an excavation in Ayodhya that was seen as yielding evidence of a Hindu temple — a determination which saw him being criticised by left historians but which strengthened VHP’s case for construction of a Ram Mandir at the disputed site. Three from the Sangh Parivar — former Gujarat CM Keshubhai Patel, Sumitra Mahajan and former governor Mridula Sinha, who passed away recently — too made the cut. The maximum 11 awards went to people from Tamil Nadu, incidentally another state headed for the polls. The Padma Vibhushan list included Puri-based sculptor Sudarshan Sahoo, cardiologist and Manipal University ex-chancellor B M Hegde, Islamic scholar Maulana Wahiduddin Khan and Indian-American Sikh physicist Narinder Singh Kapany, known for his work in the field of fibre optics. Playback singer K S Chithra was given the Padma Bhushan. Rattan Lal was awarded Padma Shri for regenerative agriculture. Pappammal from Coimbatore, who runs her own organic farm, was conferred Padma Shri. The 10 Padma Bhushan awardees include Islamic spiritual leader Kalbe Sadiq (posthumous), former MP and ex-chairman of National Commission for Minorities Tarlochan Singh, who has worked for the Sikh community, Kannada poet and playwright Chandrashekhar Kambara, and Maharashtra-based industrialist Rajnikant Devidas Shroff. In the Padma Shri list are former Union minister from Assam Bijoya Chakravarty. Among sportspersons in the Padma Shri list are basketball player P Anitha, table tennis player Mouma Das, athlete Sudha Hari Narayan Singh, para-sportsman K Y Venkatesh, wrestler Virender Singh and mountaineer Anshu Jamsenpa. The list, like the past few years, includes many unsung heroes in fields like art, social work, agriculture and also in a new category — grassroots innovation. From the field of trade and industry, Punjab-based Cremica founder Rajni Bector, late P Subramanian of Shanthi Gears based in Coimbatore who was also a philanthropist, and Zoho Corporation CEO Sridhar Vembu, have been conferred Padma Shri. Greek Indologist Nicholas Kazanas was awarded Padma Shri in the "literature and education" category, the former posthumously.

NEW DELHI: The Centre has asked all states and Union Territories to tighten security during Tuesday's 'Bharat Bandh' called by the farmers unions and supported by opposition parties, while asserting that peace and tranquillity must be maintained on that day, officials said. In a countrywide advisory, the Union Home Ministry also said the state governments and UT administrations must ensure that the Covid-19 guidelines issued with regard to health and social distancing are strictly followed. The 'Bharat Bandh' has been called by the farmers unions who have been protesting the three farm laws enacted in the Monsoon Session of Parliament. Major political parties on Sunday came out in strong support of the bandh. Here is all you want to know about new farm laws.  Key provisions of the lawsThe key provisions of new farm laws are intended to help small and marginal farmers (86% of total farmers) who don’t have means to either bargain for their produce to get a better price or invest in technology to improve the productivity of farms. The Act on Agri market allows farmers to sell their produce outside APMC ‘mandis’ to whoever they want. Anyone can buy their produce even at their farm gates. Though ‘commission agents’ of the ‘mandis’ and states could lose 'commissions' and 'mandi fees' respectively (the main reasons for the current protests), farmers will get better prices through competition and cost-cutting on transportation.The law on contract farming will, on the other hand, allow farmers to enter into a contract with agri-business firms or large retailers on pre-agreed prices of their produce. This will help small and marginal farmers as the legislation will transfer the risk of market unpredictability from the farmer to the sponsor. The third law seeks to remove commodities like cereals, pulses, oilseeds, edible oils, onion and potatoes from the list of essential commodities. This provision will attract private sector/foreign direct investment into the agriculture sector.  What farmers fear:Farmer unions in Punjab and Haryana say the recent laws enacted at the Centre will dismantle the minimum support price (MSP) system. Over time big corporate houses will dictate terms and farmers will end up getting less for their crops, they argue. Farmers fear that with the virtual disbanding of the mandi system, they will not get an assured price for their crops and the “arthiyas” -- commission agents who also pitch in with loans for them -- will be out of business. Farmers demands:The key demand is the withdrawal of the three laws which deregulate the sale of their crops. The farmer unions could also settle for a legal assurance that the MSP system will continue, ideally through an amendment to the laws.They are also pressing for the withdrawal of the proposed Electricity (Amendment) Bill 2020, fearing it will lead to an end to subsidised electricity. Farmers say rules against stubble burning should also not apply to them. How MSP affects farmersMSP is the minimum price paid by the government when it procures any crop from the farmers. It is announced by the state-run Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) for more than 22 commodities on an annual basis, after calculating the cost of cultivation. Food Corporation of India (FCI) -- which is the main state-run grain procurement agency -- largely buys only paddy and wheat at these prices. The FCI then sells these foodgrains at highly subsidised prices to the poor and is thereafter compensated by the government for its losses. What the government saysThe three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. Until 2020, the first sale of agriculture produce could occur only at the mandis of the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC). However, after the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 came into force it allows farmers to sell outside APMC mandis in India.

Hospitals and health centres across several cities and towns in many states and UTs could not achieve their Covid-19 vaccination targets on Tuesday thanks to continuing hesitancy among health workers in taking the shot, with a section of doctors in hospitals in Hyderabad even writing letters to their superiors, saying they would rather wait for more options before they take a jab. Reports of several cases of adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) were among the factors which caused health workers to skip the inoculations despite their names listed at the centres. “There’re cases of adverse effects being reported for the available vaccines and one is still under trial,” read a letter by a senior resident at Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (TIMS) in Hyderabad, referring to Covaxin. “I prefer to wait until there is a better vaccine available,” the doctor said in the letter. As many as 67 health workers at TIMS refused to take the jab on Tuesday. “If I take the vaccine now, I will not be able to take another vaccine in the near future, which might have better efficacy,” wrote a senior doctor from Osmania General Hospital, where less than 200 out of the 600 beneficiaries listed took the vaccine Scores of health workers skipped inoculation in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad in Maharashtra because of hesitancy. The deputy director for health services, Sanjay Deshmukh, said the refusals were due to anxiety over safety and efficacy of the vaccines. In Nagpur’s Government Medical College and Hospital, the exclusive centre for Covaxin in the city, only 29 out of 100 beneficiaries took the jab on Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: Amidst protest from opposition and a section of farmer's organisations, the Monsoon Session of the Lok Sabha passed three agriculture sector bills which will replace the existing ordinances once they are passed by the Rajya Sabha also. On Thursday, SAD leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal resigned from the Union council of ministers protesting against the bills which she said are anti-farmer and will destroy the agriculture sector in Punjab. Here is all you need to know about the three bills: 1. Bill on agri marketFarmer's Produce Trade and Commerce(Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020Provisions* To create an ecosystem where farmers and traders enjoy the freedom to sell and purchase farm produce outide registered 'mandis' under states' APMCs. * To promote barrier-free inter-state and intra-state trade of farmers' produce * To reduce marketing/transportation costs and help farmers in getting better prices * To provide a facilitative framework for electronic trading Opposition* States will lose revenue as they won't be able to collect 'mandi fees' if farmers sell their produce outside registered APMC markets. * What happens to 'commission agents' in states if entire farm trade moves out of mandis? * It may eventually end the MSP-based procurement system. * Electronic trading like in e-NAM uses physical 'mandi' structure. What will happen to e-NAM if 'mandis' are destroyed in absence of trading? New farm bill 2020: Who is protesting &amp; why2. Bill on contract farmingThe Farmer (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020Provisions* Farmers can enter into a contract with agribusiness firms, processors, wholesalers, exporters or large retailers for sale of future farming produce at a pre-agreed price * Marginal and small farmers, with land less than five hectares, to gain via aggregation and contract (Marginal and small farmers account for 86% of total farmers in India) * To transfer the risk of market unpredictability from farmers to sponsors * To enable farmers to access modern tech and get better inputs * To reduce cost of marketing and boost farmer's income. * Farmers can engage in direct marketing by eliminating intermediaries for full price realisation * Effective dispute resolution mechanism with redressal timelines. Opposition* Farmers in contract farming arrangements will be the weaker players in terms of their ability to negotiate what they need * The sponsors may not like to deal with a multitude of small and marginal farmers * Being big private companies, exporters, wholesalers and processors, the sponsors will have an edge in disputes. 3. Bill relating to commoditiesThe Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020Provisions* To remove commodities like cereals, pulses, oilseeds, onion and potatoes from the list of essential commodities. It will do away with the imposition of stockholding limits on such items except under "extraordinary circumstances" like war * This provision will attract private sector/FDI into farm sector as it will remove fears of private investors of excessive regulatory interference in business operations. * To bring investment for farm infrastructure like cold storages, and modernising food supply chain. * To help both farmers and consumers by bringing in price stability. * To create competitive market environment and cut wastage of farm produce. Opposition* Price limits for "extraordinary circumstances" are so high that they are likely to be never triggered. * Big companies will have the freedom to stock commodities- it means they will dictate terms to farmers which may lead to less prices for the cultivators. * Recent decision on export ban on onion creates doubt on its implementation.

NEW DELHI: The novel coronavirus is now spreading much more rapidly outside China than within the country, leading the world into uncharted territory, but the outbreak can still be contained, the World Health Organization said on Monday. The virus has so far claimed over 3,000 lives and there are over 90,000 confirmed cases.  What is coronavirus?Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. What are zoonotic?Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. What are the signs of infections?Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, the infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. How to prevent infection from spreading?Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Stay home when you are sick. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. Who should wear a facemask?It is not necessary for people who are well to wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases. Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others, Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said. What is the treatment for novel coronavirus?There is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for COVID-19. People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. For severe cases, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions. People who think they may have been exposed to COVID-19 should contact their healthcare provider immediately. Here is a list of dos and don'ts issued by the government to stall the spread of the virus in the country —Do's Cover your nose and mouth with disposable tissue or handkerchief Frequently wash your hands with soap and water Avoid crowded places Person suffering from Influenza like illness must be confined at home Stay more than one arm's length distance from persons sick with flu Take adequate sleep and rest Drink plenty of water/liquids and eat nutritious food Person suspected with Influenza like illness must consult doctor Don'ts Touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands while coughing or sneezing Hugging, kissing and shaking hands while greeting Spitting in public places Taking medicines without consulting doctor Disposal of used napkin or tissue paper in open areas Touching surfaces usually used by public (railing, door, gates, etc)

NEW DELHI: Several parts of the country, including Odisha, Kerala, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Delhi, are witnessing a solar eclipse on Thursday morning, which is said to the last one of the decade. The solar eclipse, which occurs when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun, began at around 8:17 am and will continue till 10:57 am today. It is also being referred to as "ring of fire" and "Surya Grahan" in Hindi. The beginning of the eclipse can be first seen from the Arabian sea coast of Oman at around 7:59 hours IST and the annular eclipse will become first visible in west of Baharain at 09:06 hours IST, Duari added. Here is all you want to know about solar eclipse.  What is a solar eclipse? A solar eclipse occurs when a portion of the Earth is engulfed in a shadow cast by the Moon which fully or partially blocks sunlight. This occurs when the Sun, Moon and Earth are aligned. Such alignment coincides with a new moon indicating the Moon is closest to the ecliptic plane. In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is obscured. If the Moon were in a perfectly circular orbit, a little closer to the Earth, and in the same orbital plane, there would be total solar eclipses every new moon. However, since the Moon's orbit is tilted at more than 5 degrees to the Earth's orbit around the Sun, its shadow usually misses Earth. A solar eclipse can only occur when the Moon is close enough to the ecliptic plane during a new moon. What is a ‘Ring of Fire’ during solar eclipse?We do not get to see a ‘Ring of Fire’ during all solar eclipses and those solar eclipses where a ‘Ring of Fire’ is visible is called an annular solar eclipse. During such an eclipse, the centre of the Sun is covered by the Moon in such a way that the outer edge of the Sun is left visible and it looks like a ring. When viewed from a long distance it looks like a ring of fire around the Moon called the 'annulus'. However, when an annular solar eclipse takes place, the ‘Ring of Fire’ is not visible from all places on earth. As a result of which the annular solar eclipse may look like a partial solar eclipse. When does an annular solar eclipse happen? We do not get to see a 'ring of fire' during all solar eclipse. For an annular solar eclipse to take place, three things need to happen — there should be a New Moon, the Moon should be at or very near a lunar node so that the Sun, Moon and the Earth all are in a straight line and the Moon should be near the apogee (the farthest point of the Moon from Earth) so that the outer edge of the Sun is visible. The 'Ring of Fire' is visible only when all these three parameters are met. When will solar eclipse start on Wednesday According to the India Meteorological Department’s Kolkata-based Positional Astronomy Centre, the solar eclipse will begin at 8am on Thursday. It will slowly increase in intensity before peaking two hours later. It will end at 1.35pm. Places where solar eclipse can be seen In Delhi, the partial eclipse will begin at 8.17am while the greatest eclipse will start at 9.30. The partial eclipse will end at 10.56am and the total duration of the eclipse will be 2 hours and 39 minutes. The solar eclipse will be at its maximum intensity at 10.47am and will remain so for a little under four minutes. The eclipse will be visible in some parts of India, Sri Lanka, UAE, Sumatra, Australia, Philippines and Singapore. People living in Ooty, Mangalore, Coimbatore, Shivagange, Tiruchirappalli and Kasaragod will be able to see the “ring of fire”. However, residents of New Delhi, Pune, Jaipur, Lucknow, Kanpur, Nagpur, Indore, Kolkata, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Surat, Bhopal, Visakhapatnam, Ludhiana and Agra will only witness a partial solar eclipse. “From India, annular phase will be visible in the morning after sunrise from some places within a narrow corridor of southern part of the country (parts of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu) and it will be seen as partial solar eclipse from the rest part of the country. The narrow corridor of annular phase of the eclipse will pass through the southern part of the country through certain places like Kannur, Coimbatore, Kozhikode, Madurai, Mangalore, Ooty, Tiruchirappalli, etc,” a bulletin of the Positional Astronomy Centre stated.  Precautions while watching the solar eclipse “The eclipse should not be viewed with the naked eye. It will cause permanent damage of the eyes even when the moon covers most portion of the sun. Safe technique to observe the solar eclipse is either by using proper filter like aluminised Mylar, black polymer and welding glass of shade number 14 or by making projection of the sun’s image on a white board by a telescope,” the bulletin stated.  Dos and donts on solar eclipseExposing your eyes to the sun without proper eye protection during a solar eclipse can cause “eclipse blindness” or retinal burns, also known as solar retinopathy, say opthalmologists. "Radiation from the sun is so powerful that regular sunglasses or lens in cameras will not be able to filter," says senior opthalmologist Dr Mohan Rajan. "Looking at the sun for more than 90 seconds exceeds threshold of retinal damage," he said. The harmful ultra violet rays from the sun can destroy cells in the retina that transmit what you see to the brain, sometimes causing permanent damage. Many times people it can occur without pain. "Symptoms can take a few hours to a few days after viewing the solar eclipse to realize the damage that has occurred," he said. Many experience loss of central vision (solar retinopathy) , distorted vision or altered color vision. Do not watch the eclipse on * Smartphone * Camera viewfinder, telescope or binoculars * Unsafe filters or glasses. Dos Use specifically designed for viewing a solar eclipse. Follow directions to use carefully

NEW DELHI: Amid the furore over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the Union Cabinet on Tuesday   approved funds   to the tune of over Rs 8,500 crore for updating the National Population Register (NPR), officials have said. The NPR exercise is to commence from April next year. The NPR is a list of "usual residents" of the country. Updating of this data was done during 2015 by conducting door-to-door survey. The digitisation of the updated information has been completed. Meanwhile, the Left parties announced a seven-day nationwide protest from January 1 to 7 and a general strike on January 8 against the CAA, the NPR and the NRC. In a joint statement, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the Communist Party of India, the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist)-Liberation, the All India Forward Bloc and the Revolutionary Socialist Party said the protest programme was announced in solidarity with the trade unions, which have also called a general strike on January 8. Now it has been decided to update the National Population Register along with the house-listing phase of Census 2021 from April to September 2020 in all the states/union territories, except Assam.  What is NPR?The National Population Register (NPR) is a register of usual residents of the country being prepared at the local (village/sub-town), sub-district, district, state and national level under provisions of the Citizenship Act 1955 and the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003. It is mandatory for every usual resident of India to register in the NPR. Under the NPR, a usual resident is defined as a person who has resided in a local area for the past six months or more or a person who intends to reside in that area for the next six months or more. What is its purpose? NPR's purpose is to create a comprehensive identity database of every usual resident in the country. The database would contain demographic as well as biometric particulars. Aadhaar, mobile number, PAN, driving license, voter ID details and Indian passport numbers are among the details that will be collected from all usual residents of India. Sharing of Aadhaar is voluntary in view of the Supreme Court ruling in this regard. What are the demographic details required?Name of person Relationship to head of household, Father’s name, Mother’s name, Spouse’s name (if married), Sex, Date of Birth, Marital status, Place of birth, Nationality (as declared), Present address of usual residence, Duration of stay at present address, Permanent residential address, Occupation/Activity, Educational qualification. What is the current status? Data for NPR was collected in 2010 during collection of data for Census of India 2011. It was updated in 2015 through a door-to-door survey. The digitisation of the updated information has been completed. NPR data will now be updated along with the house-listing phase of Census 2021 from April-September 2020 in all states except Assam. A gazette notification to this effect has already been published by the central government. Which states have blocked NPR? The West Bengal government this month stayed all activities related to the preparation and updation of NPR. The decision came amid violent protests in parts of the state over CAA and chief minister Mamata Banerjee reiterating that the law and the proposed pan-India NRC will not be implemented in the state. Mamata Banerjee said, "All activities regarding the preparation and updation of the National Population Register are stayed in West Bengal. No activity regarding NRP may be taken up without clearance from the government of West Bengal." Kerala and Rajasthan have followed suit, saying they will not work on compiling the NPR as mandated by the Centre to record 'basic information' on citizens. "After considering the concerns raised in the wake of the 2019 amendment in the Citizenship Act, the state government has decided not to cooperate with the process to update the NPR to facilitate the preparation of the NRC," the office of Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said in a statement last week. Why is Assam excludedAs of now, the NPR exercise is not being undertaken in Assam. Assam recently had the NRC exercise undertaken to identify and detain illegal immigrants. The purpose of a pan-India NRC it to detect illegal immigrants and detain them, irrespective of faith, however there are concerns it could arbitrarily exclude genuine Indian citizens. How can NPR data be accessed NPR data will not be put in the public domain but will remain a secure database accessible to the relevant user through password protected protocols. The government says it will use the data to enhance the targeting of beneficiary-oriented schemes and will have implications on improving internal security.

NEW DELHI: Amid the protests across the country over the amended Citizenship Act, the government has said that there is no link between the new law and NRC. Home minister Amit Shah had earlier set a 2024 deadline for implementing the NRC across the country. Meanwhile, the Centre on Thursday clarified that the exercise to prepare an all-India National Register for Citizens — National Register of Indian Citizens (NRIC), as per the Citizenship Rules, 2003 — was yet to be notified and as and when it is done, rules and instructions would be framed in such a way that no Indian citizen is inconvenienced. Here is all you need to know about the NRC:  What is NRC (National Register of Citizens)?NRC means the National Register of Citizens. NRC is a list of Assam's residents – prepared to identify bonafide residents and deport illegal migrants in the northeastern state bordering Bangladesh. So far, this has been a state-specific exercise to keep its ethnic uniqueness unaltered.But ever since its implementation, there has been a growing demand for its nationwide implementation. Many top BJP leaders, including home minister Amit Shah have proposed that the NRC in Assam be implemented across India. It effectively suggests to bring a legislation that will enable the government to identify infiltrators who have been living in India illegally, detain them and finally deport them where they came from. Who stands to lose?The proposed Bill, which till now remains just a proposal, if implemented will target illegal immigrants in India. But Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhist, Jains and Parsis coming from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh won't be affected, if they claim they have arrived India after fleeing religious persecution. It essentially means, if a nationwide NRC is implemented as proposed, any illegal immigrant from other than Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, will be affected. And as for those three nations, people coming from there who belong to the Muslim community will also be affected as they are not included in the Citizenship Amendment Act. Who will be excluded?As proposed, if a nationwide NRC comes in place, the affected will be detained and taken to large detention centres, as it is happening in Assam. After that, the ministry of external affairs will get in touch with the concerned nations. If the details of the detained are matched and accepted by the concerned nations, deportations will follow. Assam is setting up detention centres exclusively for those declared foreigners after exhausting all legal routes. Repatriation of such people looks difficult as India and Bangladesh do not have any treaty in this regard at this point of time. The politics of NRCAmit Shah has been raising the pitch for a nationwide NRC for some time now. As late as this October, Shah raised the matter in West Bengal, not far from Assam. In Haryana, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar too made the promise of bringing the NRC in the state during his election campaigning. Even Mohan Bhagwat, the RSS supremo has been pitching for the same, though behind closed doors. Possibility of NRC in the rest of IndiaThe Centre has been pushing for NRCs in every state. Nagaland has already started an exercise to create a similar database of citizens known as the Register of Indigenous Inhabitants. The Centre has also announced plans for a National Population Register (NPR) which will contain demographic and bio-metric details of citizens.

 What is Citizenship (Amendment) Bill?The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill seeks to provide Indian nationality to six communities — Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Parsis, Jains and Buddhists fleeing persecution from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.The bill amends the Citizenship Act, 1955 to make illegal migrants in the select categories eligible for citizenship. What does the government say:Home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday rejected the Opposition's charge that the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill was anti-Muslim, saying it does not take away the citizenship of any Indian Muslim and only seeks to given the same to persecuted minorities of three neighbouring countries. Replying to a debate on the bill in Rajya Sabha, he said the need to bring this Bill would not have arisen had Partition not taken place on the basis of religion. The Bill does not snatch citizenship of Muslims and their is no need for them to have any fear, he said. What does the opposition say:The legislation has been attacked by opposition parties, minority outfits and others for leaving out Muslims and also on the grounds that it is at odds with the Constitution, which does not differentiate between citizens on the basis of their faith. Who are the parties opposing/supporting the Bill?Congress, Trinamool, DMK, Samajwadi Party, RJD and Left, and even parties like Shiv Sena and BJD have expressed reservations. BJP's Assam ally AGP seemed to have warmed up to the idea of CAB after the government assured changes to the Bill. The government has the support of regional allies — Akali Dal and JD(U). AIADMK also voted in favour of the Bill in Rajya Sabha. Why are some northeast states opposing the Bill?The CAB has sparked resentment in the northeast as it is feared that granting citizenship to foreign refugees will undermine the ethnic communities living in these regions.There are indications that the government is working out a compromise. Formulations like provision of citizenship not leading to residency status in the smaller north-east states were discussed. Why has BJP's Assam-ally AGP taken a U-turn on CAB?In January last year, BJP's ally Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) had pulled out of NDA after Lok Sabha passed the earlier version of the Bill, which BJP had introduced in Parliament in 2016. When the Bill lapsed in the Lok Sabha, AGP returned to the alliance.Recently, the AGP has indicated a U-turn on the proposed Bill. “We have to move forward with the reality — neither can we expel lakhs of illegal migrants nor will Bangladesh ever take them back. We had our government twice in the past but we could not even identify the illegal migrants. Unfortunately, the Assam Accord has only gathered dust for over 34 years," AGP member and Assam minister Atul Bora said.

NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha on Monday passed Right to Information (Amendment) Bill, after division that allows the Central government to notify the term of office for the Chief Information Commissioner (CIC) and Information Commissioners (ICs) with the Opposition slamming the measure as diluting the provisions of the legislation. The Right to Information (Amendment) Bill, 2019 was passed with 218 members voting in its favour and 79 against it after a reply by Minister of state for personnel, public grievances and pensions, Jitendra Singh. The 2005 Act was enacted during the first Congress-led government UPA government. According to the activists, the efficacy of the RTI Act, allowing any Indian to seek information from any authority on the payment of Rs 10, hinges closely on the independence of the CIC and its equivalents in the states — state information commissions that adjudicate the matter in case information is not furnished to applicants within the parameters of the law. Here is explain: What’s changed in Parliament: While Lok Sabha was never a problem, the NDA’s weakling status in the Rajya Sabha prevented it from pushing several contentious bills — with its total strength in the Upper House less than that of the Opposition. However, that may not be a problem any longer as the NDA, along with some ‘friendly’ parties such as the TRS, YSRCP, BJD and others has a strength of 127 in the 245 member House of Elders, more than the halfway mark of 123. That should help it push through the bill after it passes in the Lok Sabha. What’s in the bill: The amended bill does away with the fixed tenure of five years for the Chief Information Commissioner (CIC) and the Information Commissioners (IC) — instead, they will serve for a tenure determined by the Central government. Moreover, the salary of the CIC and the ICs which are currently benchmarked with the salary of the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and the Election Commissioners respectively, which in turn are benchmarked with the salary of a Supreme Court judge, amount to Rs 2.50 lakh, along with a monthly allowance of Rs 34,000 per month — plus the usual perks like rent free furnished accommodation and 200 litres of fuel every month. The amended bill gives the government to fix the salary, which could be lower — given that the Information Commission is a statutory body unlike the EC which is a constitutional body. However, the current incumbents’ salaries will not be affected by the amendment. How will that affect RTI? Currently, the CIC and the IC are chosen by a three member panel of the PM, the Leader of Opposition or leader of the largest opposition party in Lok Sabha and a Cabinet minister nominated by the PM. Similarly, the State Chief Information Commissioners (SCIC) and State Information Commissioners (SIC) are chosen by a three member panel comprising the state CM, the state’s leader of opposition or leader of the largest opposition party in the state assembly and a state cabinet minister nominated the chief minister. The amended bill arrogates the power of appointment and the term as well as the salary of SCIC and SIC to the Central government — which nullifies the independence of the state legislatures. Even the CIC and the ICs will serve at the pleasure of the government — raising the possibility that they would be more interested in ensuring the longevity of their tenures rather than serving the citizens’ interests. Termination of terms? Current rules stipulate that no CIC, IC, SCIC or SIC serve more than one term, for a maximum period of 5 years or till the age of 65, whichever is earlier. For ICs and SICs, if one of them is nominated to the post of CIC or SCIC, his/her total tenure as both IC and CIC or SIC and SCIC can not exceed 5 years. While the new bill gives the government the power to fix tenures, it's not clear whether an incumbent seen as pliable or ‘friendly’ to the Centre may get to serve more than one term. Appointments & dismissals: If the tenure of the CIC, IC, SCIC and SIC are to be fixed by the Centre, it may follow that their removal from office may also be dependent on the Centre — whereas in the original bill, the CIC and IC may be removed only by the President — and the state Governor in case of SCIC and SIC — after an enquiry by the Supreme Court finds reason for their dismissal from office.

NEW DELHI: Indian and Chinese troops physically clashed once again in the high-altitude area of Naku La in north Sikkim last week, with several soldiers being injured on both sides after Indian troops repelled an attempt by Chinese troops to enter Indian territory. The Chinese actions served as a grim reminder of the assertiveness shown by the People’s Liberation Army all along the Line of Actual Control even as Indian Army remains in a state of high alertness to respond to aggressive actions. The Indian Army on Monday said it was a “minor face-off” at Naku La on January 20, which was “resolved by local commanders as per established protocols”. The action was, however, denied by Chinese government media mouthpiece Global Times which said no clash had occurred, claiming this was fake news. The brawl took place after Indian troops challenged a bid by the PLA to once again intrude into Indian territory at Naku La, which saw both sides rush reinforcements to the area. “Though no weapons were used during the incident, injuries were sustained on both sides. It was bigger than a routine scuffle. The situation is tense but under control,” a source said. Indian and Chinese troops had also clashed at Naku La on May 9 last year, which had left several soldiers on both sides injured, just after the violent clashes on the north bank of Pangong Tso in eastern Ladakh on May 5-6 after multiple PLA incursions into Indian territory. Later, a deadly physical clash at Galwan on June 15 night claimed 20 Indian lives and an unspecified number of Chinese soldiers died too. An Indian Army lieutenant had even punched a major from the PLA during the May 9 clash at Naku La, a sector located at an altitude of about 17,000 feet that has never been contested by China in the past. Though the troop face-off at Naku La had eased after some days, the eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation still continues at the ‘friction points’ in Pangong Tso, Chushul and Gogra-Hotsprings areas of eastern Ladakh. But what had come as a surprise was PLA’s aggressive behaviour in “new areas” like Naku La, which is located ahead of Muguthang in north Sikkim. Naku La has never figured in the 23 “disputed and sensitive areas” that have witnessed frequent transgressions and troop face-offs along the 3,488-km long LAC for years. Pangong Tso figures high on the list, with the other areas in Ladakh being Trig Heights, Demchok, Dumchele, Chumar and Spanggur Gap. In Arunachal, the flashpoints are Namkha Chu, Sumdorong Chu, Asaphila, Dichu, Yangtse and the so-called ‘Fish Tail-I and II’ areas in Dibang Valley. In the middle sector, the disputed areas include Barahoti, Kaurik and Shipki La.

NEW DELHI: As India observes its 72nd Republic Day today, Google marked the occasion with a creative doodle illustrated by Mumbai-based guest artist Onkar Fondekar. The search-engine giant shared a beautiful creation for people to celebrate January 26, showcasing the diversity and range of vibrant cultures that bring this colorful nation to life. "I drew inspiration from the people of India—the culture, traditions, history, and architecture," Fondekar said. Republic Day honours the date January 26, 1950, as on this date, 72 years ago, the Constitution of India came into effect by replacing the Government of India act (1935). The country officially transits to a sovereign republic. A full size illustration of Google doodleOn this day, every nook and cranny of the country, including India's capital, is decorated with people enjoying their day off. While Republic Day only dates back to 1949, many subcontinent elements have been evolving for centuries. With origins that stretch back hundreds of years, musical instruments such as the dholak (a two-headed hand drum) and the sitar (a long-necked stringed instrument), both featured in the Doodle artwork, are just a few examples of India's rich heritage. From its distinctive architectural styles to the Bollywood film industry, India's cultural impact is felt globally, and today, there is much to celebrate. Happy Republic Day, India!

Bhawani Sharma, a nursing staff at Kanwatia Hospital in Jaipur, has been spending a lot of time these days doubling up as a self-styled counsellor. Sharma took the Covaxin jab on Saturday when the vaccination drive was rolled out across the country but found many of her colleagues hesitant to roll up their sleeves for a shot of the indigenously-developed Covaxin. “I have had no side effects,” Sharma has been going around telling others in her hospital. Five days into the nationwide drive — which saw the first phase being rolled out for healthcare workers in the frontline of Covid duty — and the dilemma whether to take the Covaxin jab has left beneficiaries in a fix. In none of the six cities, where Covaxin was made available, that TOI surveyed, did the percentage of healthcare workers going for the Covaxin shot reach 50%. Till Tuesday evening, Patna and Jaipur had clocked the highest of 49% while Mumbai and Delhi were at 31% and 33% respectively. Hospitals administering the vaccine have reported a higher percentage of beneficiaries taking the Covishield shot. “There is some hesitancy. We have seen some outright refusals too. However, what has equally contributed to the low acceptability are the glitches in the Co-Win application. We have not been able to intimate beneficiaries on time,” said Dr Lalit Sankhe, nodal officer for Covaxin at Mumbai’s JJ Hospital, the only centre in Mumbai with Covaxin. In Delhi, doctors have reported a “little higher hesitancy for Covaxin due to lack of efficacy data.” Covaxin is being administered in six central government-run hospitals in Delhi whereas Covishield is being given in all state-run and private hospitals. This has led to confusion and dissatisfaction among healthcare workers “Several doctors and PG students are not ready to take Covaxin as the third trial of this vaccine is in its initial stage. At least, the efficacy rate of Covishield is around 70% after its final trial,” said Dr Vinay Kumar, a senior resident at the AIIMS-Patna. In Pune, an official of the district hospital in Aundh said there was a general feeling among healthcare workers that they were being used as “guinea pigs”. “There are reports of anaphylactic reactions. I have decided to wait and I have also asked my junior doctors to wait,” said a senior gynecologist based in Chennai. (With inputs from Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Patna, Jaipur and Pune)

NEW DELHI: Indian and Chinese troops physically clashed once again in the high-altitude area of Naku La in north Sikkim last week, with several soldiers being injured on both sides after Indian troops repelled an attempt by Chinese troops to enter Indian territory. The Chinese actions served as a grim reminder of the assertiveness shown by the People’s Liberation Army all along the Line of Actual Control even as Indian Army remains in a state of high alertness to respond to aggressive actions. The Indian Army on Monday said it was a “minor face-off” at Naku La on January 20, which was “resolved by local commanders as per established protocols”. The action was, however, denied by Chinese government media mouthpiece Global Times which said no clash had occurred, claiming this was fake news. The brawl took place after Indian troops challenged a bid by the PLA to once again intrude into Indian territory at Naku La, which saw both sides rush reinforcements to the area. “Though no weapons were used during the incident, injuries were sustained on both sides. It was bigger than a routine scuffle. The situation is tense but under control,” a source said. Indian and Chinese troops had also clashed at Naku La on May 9 last year, which had left several soldiers on both sides injured, just after the violent clashes on the north bank of Pangong Tso in eastern Ladakh on May 5-6 after multiple PLA incursions into Indian territory. Later, a deadly physical clash at Galwan on June 15 night claimed 20 Indian lives and an unspecified number of Chinese soldiers died too. An Indian Army lieutenant had even punched a major from the PLA during the May 9 clash at Naku La, a sector located at an altitude of about 17,000 feet that has never been contested by China in the past. Though the troop face-off at Naku La had eased after some days, the eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation still continues at the ‘friction points’ in Pangong Tso, Chushul and Gogra-Hotsprings areas of eastern Ladakh. But what had come as a surprise was PLA’s aggressive behaviour in “new areas” like Naku La, which is located ahead of Muguthang in north Sikkim. Naku La has never figured in the 23 “disputed and sensitive areas” that have witnessed frequent transgressions and troop face-offs along the 3,488-km long LAC for years. Pangong Tso figures high on the list, with the other areas in Ladakh being Trig Heights, Demchok, Dumchele, Chumar and Spanggur Gap. In Arunachal, the flashpoints are Namkha Chu, Sumdorong Chu, Asaphila, Dichu, Yangtse and the so-called ‘Fish Tail-I and II’ areas in Dibang Valley. In the middle sector, the disputed areas include Barahoti, Kaurik and Shipki La.

NEW DELHI: Former Japanese PM Shinzo Abe and late singer S P Balasubrahmanyam were conferred the Padma Vibhushan on Monday, while former Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan, Dalit leader and LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan, Tarun Gogoi and Keshubhai Patel (all three posthumously) and ex-principal secretary to the PM, Nripendra Misra, have been named for the Padma Bhushan. In a list which under the Modi government has shown a tilt towards "Bharat" or the grassroots, as many as 119 Padma awards — seven Padma Vibhushan, 10 Padma Bhushan and 102 Padma Shri — were announced. Among the awardees are 29 women and one transgender, while 10 are foreigners, NRIs, persons of Indian origin or overseas citizens of India. Sixteen awards have been conferred posthumously. "Dom Raja" of Varanasi, Jagdish Chaudhary, who had signed PM Narendra Modi’s nomination papers in the 2019 LS poll, was also posthumously awarded Padma Shri for social work. Apart from Abe, who shares a good equation with Modi and is seen as a prime architect of the Indo-Pacific strategy, other foreign nationals share a strong India connect. UK filmmaker Peter Brooks, who made the well-received film "Mahabharata" based on his nine-hour play, and the late Father Valles, a Spanish Jesuit priest who lived and worked in Gujarat, have been honoured with Padma Shri. No Bharat Ratna was announced this year as well. The focus on low-profile achievers was best reflected in the selection of recipients from the art, culture and medicine categories, with many recipients hailing from the hinterland. The choice of the late Congress leader Gogoi, former CM of poll-bound Assam, is significant and will strike many as a shrewd move. B B Lal is another interesting pick in the Padma Vibhushan list. The reputed archaeologist was head of the ASI during an excavation in Ayodhya that was seen as yielding evidence of a Hindu temple — a determination which saw him being criticised by left historians but which strengthened VHP’s case for construction of a Ram Mandir at the disputed site. Three from the Sangh Parivar — former Gujarat CM Keshubhai Patel, Sumitra Mahajan and former governor Mridula Sinha, who passed away recently — too made the cut. The maximum 11 awards went to people from Tamil Nadu, incidentally another state headed for the polls. The Padma Vibhushan list included Puri-based sculptor Sudarshan Sahoo, cardiologist and Manipal University ex-chancellor B M Hegde, Islamic scholar Maulana Wahiduddin Khan and Indian-American Sikh physicist Narinder Singh Kapany, known for his work in the field of fibre optics. Playback singer K S Chithra was given the Padma Bhushan. Rattan Lal was awarded Padma Shri for regenerative agriculture. Pappammal from Coimbatore, who runs her own organic farm, was conferred Padma Shri. The 10 Padma Bhushan awardees include Islamic spiritual leader Kalbe Sadiq (posthumous), former MP and ex-chairman of National Commission for Minorities Tarlochan Singh, who has worked for the Sikh community, Kannada poet and playwright Chandrashekhar Kambara, and Maharashtra-based industrialist Rajnikant Devidas Shroff. In the Padma Shri list are former Union minister from Assam Bijoya Chakravarty. Among sportspersons in the Padma Shri list are basketball player P Anitha, table tennis player Mouma Das, athlete Sudha Hari Narayan Singh, para-sportsman K Y Venkatesh, wrestler Virender Singh and mountaineer Anshu Jamsenpa. The list, like the past few years, includes many unsung heroes in fields like art, social work, agriculture and also in a new category — grassroots innovation. From the field of trade and industry, Punjab-based Cremica founder Rajni Bector, late P Subramanian of Shanthi Gears based in Coimbatore who was also a philanthropist, and Zoho Corporation CEO Sridhar Vembu, have been conferred Padma Shri. Greek Indologist Nicholas Kazanas was awarded Padma Shri in the "literature and education" category, the former posthumously.

NEW DELHI: The Centre has asked all states and Union Territories to tighten security during Tuesday's 'Bharat Bandh' called by the farmers unions and supported by opposition parties, while asserting that peace and tranquillity must be maintained on that day, officials said. In a countrywide advisory, the Union Home Ministry also said the state governments and UT administrations must ensure that the Covid-19 guidelines issued with regard to health and social distancing are strictly followed. The 'Bharat Bandh' has been called by the farmers unions who have been protesting the three farm laws enacted in the Monsoon Session of Parliament. Major political parties on Sunday came out in strong support of the bandh. Here is all you want to know about new farm laws.  Key provisions of the lawsThe key provisions of new farm laws are intended to help small and marginal farmers (86% of total farmers) who don’t have means to either bargain for their produce to get a better price or invest in technology to improve the productivity of farms. The Act on Agri market allows farmers to sell their produce outside APMC ‘mandis’ to whoever they want. Anyone can buy their produce even at their farm gates. Though ‘commission agents’ of the ‘mandis’ and states could lose 'commissions' and 'mandi fees' respectively (the main reasons for the current protests), farmers will get better prices through competition and cost-cutting on transportation.The law on contract farming will, on the other hand, allow farmers to enter into a contract with agri-business firms or large retailers on pre-agreed prices of their produce. This will help small and marginal farmers as the legislation will transfer the risk of market unpredictability from the farmer to the sponsor. The third law seeks to remove commodities like cereals, pulses, oilseeds, edible oils, onion and potatoes from the list of essential commodities. This provision will attract private sector/foreign direct investment into the agriculture sector.  What farmers fear:Farmer unions in Punjab and Haryana say the recent laws enacted at the Centre will dismantle the minimum support price (MSP) system. Over time big corporate houses will dictate terms and farmers will end up getting less for their crops, they argue. Farmers fear that with the virtual disbanding of the mandi system, they will not get an assured price for their crops and the “arthiyas” -- commission agents who also pitch in with loans for them -- will be out of business. Farmers demands:The key demand is the withdrawal of the three laws which deregulate the sale of their crops. The farmer unions could also settle for a legal assurance that the MSP system will continue, ideally through an amendment to the laws.They are also pressing for the withdrawal of the proposed Electricity (Amendment) Bill 2020, fearing it will lead to an end to subsidised electricity. Farmers say rules against stubble burning should also not apply to them. How MSP affects farmersMSP is the minimum price paid by the government when it procures any crop from the farmers. It is announced by the state-run Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) for more than 22 commodities on an annual basis, after calculating the cost of cultivation. Food Corporation of India (FCI) -- which is the main state-run grain procurement agency -- largely buys only paddy and wheat at these prices. The FCI then sells these foodgrains at highly subsidised prices to the poor and is thereafter compensated by the government for its losses. What the government saysThe three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. Until 2020, the first sale of agriculture produce could occur only at the mandis of the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC). However, after the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 came into force it allows farmers to sell outside APMC mandis in India.

Hospitals and health centres across several cities and towns in many states and UTs could not achieve their Covid-19 vaccination targets on Tuesday thanks to continuing hesitancy among health workers in taking the shot, with a section of doctors in hospitals in Hyderabad even writing letters to their superiors, saying they would rather wait for more options before they take a jab. Reports of several cases of adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) were among the factors which caused health workers to skip the inoculations despite their names listed at the centres. “There’re cases of adverse effects being reported for the available vaccines and one is still under trial,” read a letter by a senior resident at Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (TIMS) in Hyderabad, referring to Covaxin. “I prefer to wait until there is a better vaccine available,” the doctor said in the letter. As many as 67 health workers at TIMS refused to take the jab on Tuesday. “If I take the vaccine now, I will not be able to take another vaccine in the near future, which might have better efficacy,” wrote a senior doctor from Osmania General Hospital, where less than 200 out of the 600 beneficiaries listed took the vaccine Scores of health workers skipped inoculation in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad in Maharashtra because of hesitancy. The deputy director for health services, Sanjay Deshmukh, said the refusals were due to anxiety over safety and efficacy of the vaccines. In Nagpur’s Government Medical College and Hospital, the exclusive centre for Covaxin in the city, only 29 out of 100 beneficiaries took the jab on Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: Amidst protest from opposition and a section of farmer's organisations, the Monsoon Session of the Lok Sabha passed three agriculture sector bills which will replace the existing ordinances once they are passed by the Rajya Sabha also. On Thursday, SAD leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal resigned from the Union council of ministers protesting against the bills which she said are anti-farmer and will destroy the agriculture sector in Punjab. Here is all you need to know about the three bills: 1. Bill on agri marketFarmer's Produce Trade and Commerce(Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020Provisions* To create an ecosystem where farmers and traders enjoy the freedom to sell and purchase farm produce outide registered 'mandis' under states' APMCs. * To promote barrier-free inter-state and intra-state trade of farmers' produce * To reduce marketing/transportation costs and help farmers in getting better prices * To provide a facilitative framework for electronic trading Opposition* States will lose revenue as they won't be able to collect 'mandi fees' if farmers sell their produce outside registered APMC markets. * What happens to 'commission agents' in states if entire farm trade moves out of mandis? * It may eventually end the MSP-based procurement system. * Electronic trading like in e-NAM uses physical 'mandi' structure. What will happen to e-NAM if 'mandis' are destroyed in absence of trading? New farm bill 2020: Who is protesting &amp; why2. Bill on contract farmingThe Farmer (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020Provisions* Farmers can enter into a contract with agribusiness firms, processors, wholesalers, exporters or large retailers for sale of future farming produce at a pre-agreed price * Marginal and small farmers, with land less than five hectares, to gain via aggregation and contract (Marginal and small farmers account for 86% of total farmers in India) * To transfer the risk of market unpredictability from farmers to sponsors * To enable farmers to access modern tech and get better inputs * To reduce cost of marketing and boost farmer's income. * Farmers can engage in direct marketing by eliminating intermediaries for full price realisation * Effective dispute resolution mechanism with redressal timelines. Opposition* Farmers in contract farming arrangements will be the weaker players in terms of their ability to negotiate what they need * The sponsors may not like to deal with a multitude of small and marginal farmers * Being big private companies, exporters, wholesalers and processors, the sponsors will have an edge in disputes. 3. Bill relating to commoditiesThe Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020Provisions* To remove commodities like cereals, pulses, oilseeds, onion and potatoes from the list of essential commodities. It will do away with the imposition of stockholding limits on such items except under "extraordinary circumstances" like war * This provision will attract private sector/FDI into farm sector as it will remove fears of private investors of excessive regulatory interference in business operations. * To bring investment for farm infrastructure like cold storages, and modernising food supply chain. * To help both farmers and consumers by bringing in price stability. * To create competitive market environment and cut wastage of farm produce. Opposition* Price limits for "extraordinary circumstances" are so high that they are likely to be never triggered. * Big companies will have the freedom to stock commodities- it means they will dictate terms to farmers which may lead to less prices for the cultivators. * Recent decision on export ban on onion creates doubt on its implementation.

NEW DELHI: The novel coronavirus is now spreading much more rapidly outside China than within the country, leading the world into uncharted territory, but the outbreak can still be contained, the World Health Organization said on Monday. The virus has so far claimed over 3,000 lives and there are over 90,000 confirmed cases.  What is coronavirus?Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. What are zoonotic?Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. What are the signs of infections?Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, the infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. How to prevent infection from spreading?Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Stay home when you are sick. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. Who should wear a facemask?It is not necessary for people who are well to wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases. Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others, Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said. What is the treatment for novel coronavirus?There is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for COVID-19. People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. For severe cases, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions. People who think they may have been exposed to COVID-19 should contact their healthcare provider immediately. Here is a list of dos and don'ts issued by the government to stall the spread of the virus in the country —Do's Cover your nose and mouth with disposable tissue or handkerchief Frequently wash your hands with soap and water Avoid crowded places Person suffering from Influenza like illness must be confined at home Stay more than one arm's length distance from persons sick with flu Take adequate sleep and rest Drink plenty of water/liquids and eat nutritious food Person suspected with Influenza like illness must consult doctor Don'ts Touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands while coughing or sneezing Hugging, kissing and shaking hands while greeting Spitting in public places Taking medicines without consulting doctor Disposal of used napkin or tissue paper in open areas Touching surfaces usually used by public (railing, door, gates, etc)

NEW DELHI: Several parts of the country, including Odisha, Kerala, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Delhi, are witnessing a solar eclipse on Thursday morning, which is said to the last one of the decade. The solar eclipse, which occurs when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun, began at around 8:17 am and will continue till 10:57 am today. It is also being referred to as "ring of fire" and "Surya Grahan" in Hindi. The beginning of the eclipse can be first seen from the Arabian sea coast of Oman at around 7:59 hours IST and the annular eclipse will become first visible in west of Baharain at 09:06 hours IST, Duari added. Here is all you want to know about solar eclipse.  What is a solar eclipse? A solar eclipse occurs when a portion of the Earth is engulfed in a shadow cast by the Moon which fully or partially blocks sunlight. This occurs when the Sun, Moon and Earth are aligned. Such alignment coincides with a new moon indicating the Moon is closest to the ecliptic plane. In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is obscured. If the Moon were in a perfectly circular orbit, a little closer to the Earth, and in the same orbital plane, there would be total solar eclipses every new moon. However, since the Moon's orbit is tilted at more than 5 degrees to the Earth's orbit around the Sun, its shadow usually misses Earth. A solar eclipse can only occur when the Moon is close enough to the ecliptic plane during a new moon. What is a ‘Ring of Fire’ during solar eclipse?We do not get to see a ‘Ring of Fire’ during all solar eclipses and those solar eclipses where a ‘Ring of Fire’ is visible is called an annular solar eclipse. During such an eclipse, the centre of the Sun is covered by the Moon in such a way that the outer edge of the Sun is left visible and it looks like a ring. When viewed from a long distance it looks like a ring of fire around the Moon called the 'annulus'. However, when an annular solar eclipse takes place, the ‘Ring of Fire’ is not visible from all places on earth. As a result of which the annular solar eclipse may look like a partial solar eclipse. When does an annular solar eclipse happen? We do not get to see a 'ring of fire' during all solar eclipse. For an annular solar eclipse to take place, three things need to happen — there should be a New Moon, the Moon should be at or very near a lunar node so that the Sun, Moon and the Earth all are in a straight line and the Moon should be near the apogee (the farthest point of the Moon from Earth) so that the outer edge of the Sun is visible. The 'Ring of Fire' is visible only when all these three parameters are met. When will solar eclipse start on Wednesday According to the India Meteorological Department’s Kolkata-based Positional Astronomy Centre, the solar eclipse will begin at 8am on Thursday. It will slowly increase in intensity before peaking two hours later. It will end at 1.35pm. Places where solar eclipse can be seen In Delhi, the partial eclipse will begin at 8.17am while the greatest eclipse will start at 9.30. The partial eclipse will end at 10.56am and the total duration of the eclipse will be 2 hours and 39 minutes. The solar eclipse will be at its maximum intensity at 10.47am and will remain so for a little under four minutes. The eclipse will be visible in some parts of India, Sri Lanka, UAE, Sumatra, Australia, Philippines and Singapore. People living in Ooty, Mangalore, Coimbatore, Shivagange, Tiruchirappalli and Kasaragod will be able to see the “ring of fire”. However, residents of New Delhi, Pune, Jaipur, Lucknow, Kanpur, Nagpur, Indore, Kolkata, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Surat, Bhopal, Visakhapatnam, Ludhiana and Agra will only witness a partial solar eclipse. “From India, annular phase will be visible in the morning after sunrise from some places within a narrow corridor of southern part of the country (parts of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu) and it will be seen as partial solar eclipse from the rest part of the country. The narrow corridor of annular phase of the eclipse will pass through the southern part of the country through certain places like Kannur, Coimbatore, Kozhikode, Madurai, Mangalore, Ooty, Tiruchirappalli, etc,” a bulletin of the Positional Astronomy Centre stated.  Precautions while watching the solar eclipse “The eclipse should not be viewed with the naked eye. It will cause permanent damage of the eyes even when the moon covers most portion of the sun. Safe technique to observe the solar eclipse is either by using proper filter like aluminised Mylar, black polymer and welding glass of shade number 14 or by making projection of the sun’s image on a white board by a telescope,” the bulletin stated.  Dos and donts on solar eclipseExposing your eyes to the sun without proper eye protection during a solar eclipse can cause “eclipse blindness” or retinal burns, also known as solar retinopathy, say opthalmologists. "Radiation from the sun is so powerful that regular sunglasses or lens in cameras will not be able to filter," says senior opthalmologist Dr Mohan Rajan. "Looking at the sun for more than 90 seconds exceeds threshold of retinal damage," he said. The harmful ultra violet rays from the sun can destroy cells in the retina that transmit what you see to the brain, sometimes causing permanent damage. Many times people it can occur without pain. "Symptoms can take a few hours to a few days after viewing the solar eclipse to realize the damage that has occurred," he said. Many experience loss of central vision (solar retinopathy) , distorted vision or altered color vision. Do not watch the eclipse on * Smartphone * Camera viewfinder, telescope or binoculars * Unsafe filters or glasses. Dos Use specifically designed for viewing a solar eclipse. Follow directions to use carefully

NEW DELHI: Amid the furore over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the Union Cabinet on Tuesday   approved funds   to the tune of over Rs 8,500 crore for updating the National Population Register (NPR), officials have said. The NPR exercise is to commence from April next year. The NPR is a list of "usual residents" of the country. Updating of this data was done during 2015 by conducting door-to-door survey. The digitisation of the updated information has been completed. Meanwhile, the Left parties announced a seven-day nationwide protest from January 1 to 7 and a general strike on January 8 against the CAA, the NPR and the NRC. In a joint statement, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the Communist Party of India, the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist)-Liberation, the All India Forward Bloc and the Revolutionary Socialist Party said the protest programme was announced in solidarity with the trade unions, which have also called a general strike on January 8. Now it has been decided to update the National Population Register along with the house-listing phase of Census 2021 from April to September 2020 in all the states/union territories, except Assam.  What is NPR?The National Population Register (NPR) is a register of usual residents of the country being prepared at the local (village/sub-town), sub-district, district, state and national level under provisions of the Citizenship Act 1955 and the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003. It is mandatory for every usual resident of India to register in the NPR. Under the NPR, a usual resident is defined as a person who has resided in a local area for the past six months or more or a person who intends to reside in that area for the next six months or more. What is its purpose? NPR's purpose is to create a comprehensive identity database of every usual resident in the country. The database would contain demographic as well as biometric particulars. Aadhaar, mobile number, PAN, driving license, voter ID details and Indian passport numbers are among the details that will be collected from all usual residents of India. Sharing of Aadhaar is voluntary in view of the Supreme Court ruling in this regard. What are the demographic details required?Name of person Relationship to head of household, Father’s name, Mother’s name, Spouse’s name (if married), Sex, Date of Birth, Marital status, Place of birth, Nationality (as declared), Present address of usual residence, Duration of stay at present address, Permanent residential address, Occupation/Activity, Educational qualification. What is the current status? Data for NPR was collected in 2010 during collection of data for Census of India 2011. It was updated in 2015 through a door-to-door survey. The digitisation of the updated information has been completed. NPR data will now be updated along with the house-listing phase of Census 2021 from April-September 2020 in all states except Assam. A gazette notification to this effect has already been published by the central government. Which states have blocked NPR? The West Bengal government this month stayed all activities related to the preparation and updation of NPR. The decision came amid violent protests in parts of the state over CAA and chief minister Mamata Banerjee reiterating that the law and the proposed pan-India NRC will not be implemented in the state. Mamata Banerjee said, "All activities regarding the preparation and updation of the National Population Register are stayed in West Bengal. No activity regarding NRP may be taken up without clearance from the government of West Bengal." Kerala and Rajasthan have followed suit, saying they will not work on compiling the NPR as mandated by the Centre to record 'basic information' on citizens. "After considering the concerns raised in the wake of the 2019 amendment in the Citizenship Act, the state government has decided not to cooperate with the process to update the NPR to facilitate the preparation of the NRC," the office of Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said in a statement last week. Why is Assam excludedAs of now, the NPR exercise is not being undertaken in Assam. Assam recently had the NRC exercise undertaken to identify and detain illegal immigrants. The purpose of a pan-India NRC it to detect illegal immigrants and detain them, irrespective of faith, however there are concerns it could arbitrarily exclude genuine Indian citizens. How can NPR data be accessed NPR data will not be put in the public domain but will remain a secure database accessible to the relevant user through password protected protocols. The government says it will use the data to enhance the targeting of beneficiary-oriented schemes and will have implications on improving internal security.

NEW DELHI: Amid the protests across the country over the amended Citizenship Act, the government has said that there is no link between the new law and NRC. Home minister Amit Shah had earlier set a 2024 deadline for implementing the NRC across the country. Meanwhile, the Centre on Thursday clarified that the exercise to prepare an all-India National Register for Citizens — National Register of Indian Citizens (NRIC), as per the Citizenship Rules, 2003 — was yet to be notified and as and when it is done, rules and instructions would be framed in such a way that no Indian citizen is inconvenienced. Here is all you need to know about the NRC:  What is NRC (National Register of Citizens)?NRC means the National Register of Citizens. NRC is a list of Assam's residents – prepared to identify bonafide residents and deport illegal migrants in the northeastern state bordering Bangladesh. So far, this has been a state-specific exercise to keep its ethnic uniqueness unaltered.But ever since its implementation, there has been a growing demand for its nationwide implementation. Many top BJP leaders, including home minister Amit Shah have proposed that the NRC in Assam be implemented across India. It effectively suggests to bring a legislation that will enable the government to identify infiltrators who have been living in India illegally, detain them and finally deport them where they came from. Who stands to lose?The proposed Bill, which till now remains just a proposal, if implemented will target illegal immigrants in India. But Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhist, Jains and Parsis coming from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh won't be affected, if they claim they have arrived India after fleeing religious persecution. It essentially means, if a nationwide NRC is implemented as proposed, any illegal immigrant from other than Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, will be affected. And as for those three nations, people coming from there who belong to the Muslim community will also be affected as they are not included in the Citizenship Amendment Act. Who will be excluded?As proposed, if a nationwide NRC comes in place, the affected will be detained and taken to large detention centres, as it is happening in Assam. After that, the ministry of external affairs will get in touch with the concerned nations. If the details of the detained are matched and accepted by the concerned nations, deportations will follow. Assam is setting up detention centres exclusively for those declared foreigners after exhausting all legal routes. Repatriation of such people looks difficult as India and Bangladesh do not have any treaty in this regard at this point of time. The politics of NRCAmit Shah has been raising the pitch for a nationwide NRC for some time now. As late as this October, Shah raised the matter in West Bengal, not far from Assam. In Haryana, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar too made the promise of bringing the NRC in the state during his election campaigning. Even Mohan Bhagwat, the RSS supremo has been pitching for the same, though behind closed doors. Possibility of NRC in the rest of IndiaThe Centre has been pushing for NRCs in every state. Nagaland has already started an exercise to create a similar database of citizens known as the Register of Indigenous Inhabitants. The Centre has also announced plans for a National Population Register (NPR) which will contain demographic and bio-metric details of citizens. A pilot NPR project was launched when the UPA government was in power but was not completed.  What is NRC (National Register of Citizens)?NRC means the National Register of Citizens.

 What is Citizenship (Amendment) Bill?The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill seeks to provide Indian nationality to six communities — Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Parsis, Jains and Buddhists fleeing persecution from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.The bill amends the Citizenship Act, 1955 to make illegal migrants in the select categories eligible for citizenship. What does the government say:Home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday rejected the Opposition's charge that the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill was anti-Muslim, saying it does not take away the citizenship of any Indian Muslim and only seeks to given the same to persecuted minorities of three neighbouring countries. Replying to a debate on the bill in Rajya Sabha, he said the need to bring this Bill would not have arisen had Partition not taken place on the basis of religion. The Bill does not snatch citizenship of Muslims and their is no need for them to have any fear, he said. What does the opposition say:The legislation has been attacked by opposition parties, minority outfits and others for leaving out Muslims and also on the grounds that it is at odds with the Constitution, which does not differentiate between citizens on the basis of their faith. Who are the parties opposing/supporting the Bill?Congress, Trinamool, DMK, Samajwadi Party, RJD and Left, and even parties like Shiv Sena and BJD have expressed reservations. BJP's Assam ally AGP seemed to have warmed up to the idea of CAB after the government assured changes to the Bill. The government has the support of regional allies — Akali Dal and JD(U). AIADMK also voted in favour of the Bill in Rajya Sabha. Why are some northeast states opposing the Bill?The CAB has sparked resentment in the northeast as it is feared that granting citizenship to foreign refugees will undermine the ethnic communities living in these regions.There are indications that the government is working out a compromise. Formulations like provision of citizenship not leading to residency status in the smaller north-east states were discussed. Why has BJP's Assam-ally AGP taken a U-turn on CAB?In January last year, BJP's ally Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) had pulled out of NDA after Lok Sabha passed the earlier version of the Bill, which BJP had introduced in Parliament in 2016. When the Bill lapsed in the Lok Sabha, AGP returned to the alliance.Recently, the AGP has indicated a U-turn on the proposed Bill. “We have to move forward with the reality — neither can we expel lakhs of illegal migrants nor will Bangladesh ever take them back. We had our government twice in the past but we could not even identify the illegal migrants. Unfortunately, the Assam Accord has only gathered dust for over 34 years," AGP member and Assam minister Atul Bora said.

NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha on Monday passed Right to Information (Amendment) Bill, after division that allows the Central government to notify the term of office for the Chief Information Commissioner (CIC) and Information Commissioners (ICs) with the Opposition slamming the measure as diluting the provisions of the legislation. The Right to Information (Amendment) Bill, 2019 was passed with 218 members voting in its favour and 79 against it after a reply by Minister of state for personnel, public grievances and pensions, Jitendra Singh. The 2005 Act was enacted during the first Congress-led government UPA government. According to the activists, the efficacy of the RTI Act, allowing any Indian to seek information from any authority on the payment of Rs 10, hinges closely on the independence of the CIC and its equivalents in the states — state information commissions that adjudicate the matter in case information is not furnished to applicants within the parameters of the law. Here is explain: What’s changed in Parliament: While Lok Sabha was never a problem, the NDA’s weakling status in the Rajya Sabha prevented it from pushing several contentious bills — with its total strength in the Upper House less than that of the Opposition. However, that may not be a problem any longer as the NDA, along with some ‘friendly’ parties such as the TRS, YSRCP, BJD and others has a strength of 127 in the 245 member House of Elders, more than the halfway mark of 123. That should help it push through the bill after it passes in the Lok Sabha. What’s in the bill: The amended bill does away with the fixed tenure of five years for the Chief Information Commissioner (CIC) and the Information Commissioners (IC) — instead, they will serve for a tenure determined by the Central government. Moreover, the salary of the CIC and the ICs which are currently benchmarked with the salary of the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and the Election Commissioners respectively, which in turn are benchmarked with the salary of a Supreme Court judge, amount to Rs 2.50 lakh, along with a monthly allowance of Rs 34,000 per month — plus the usual perks like rent free furnished accommodation and 200 litres of fuel every month. The amended bill gives the government to fix the salary, which could be lower — given that the Information Commission is a statutory body unlike the EC which is a constitutional body. However, the current incumbents’ salaries will not be affected by the amendment. How will that affect RTI? Currently, the CIC and the IC are chosen by a three member panel of the PM, the Leader of Opposition or leader of the largest opposition party in Lok Sabha and a Cabinet minister nominated by the PM. Similarly, the State Chief Information Commissioners (SCIC) and State Information Commissioners (SIC) are chosen by a three member panel comprising the state CM, the state’s leader of opposition or leader of the largest opposition party in the state assembly and a state cabinet minister nominated the chief minister. The amended bill arrogates the power of appointment and the term as well as the salary of SCIC and SIC to the Central government — which nullifies the independence of the state legislatures. Even the CIC and the ICs will serve at the pleasure of the government — raising the possibility that they would be more interested in ensuring the longevity of their tenures rather than serving the citizens’ interests. Termination of terms? Current rules stipulate that no CIC, IC, SCIC or SIC serve more than one term, for a maximum period of 5 years or till the age of 65, whichever is earlier. For ICs and SICs, if one of them is nominated to the post of CIC or SCIC, his/her total tenure as both IC and CIC or SIC and SCIC can not exceed 5 years. While the new bill gives the government the power to fix tenures, it's not clear whether an incumbent seen as pliable or ‘friendly’ to the Centre may get to serve more than one term. Appointments & dismissals: If the tenure of the CIC, IC, SCIC and SIC are to be fixed by the Centre, it may follow that their removal from office may also be dependent on the Centre — whereas in the original bill, the CIC and IC may be removed only by the President — and the state Governor in case of SCIC and SIC — after an enquiry by the Supreme Court finds reason for their dismissal from office.

NEW DELHI: Indian and Chinese troops physically clashed once again in the high-altitude area of Naku La in north Sikkim last week, with several soldiers being injured on both sides after Indian troops repelled an attempt by Chinese troops to enter Indian territory. The Chinese actions served as a grim reminder of the assertiveness shown by the People’s Liberation Army all along the Line of Actual Control even as Indian Army remains in a state of high alertness to respond to aggressive actions. The Indian Army on Monday said it was a “minor face-off” at Naku La on January 20, which was “resolved by local commanders as per established protocols”. The action was, however, denied by Chinese government media mouthpiece Global Times which said no clash had occurred, claiming this was fake news. The brawl took place after Indian troops challenged a bid by the PLA to once again intrude into Indian territory at Naku La, which saw both sides rush reinforcements to the area. “Though no weapons were used during the incident, injuries were sustained on both sides. It was bigger than a routine scuffle. The situation is tense but under control,” a source said. Indian and Chinese troops had also clashed at Naku La on May 9 last year, which had left several soldiers on both sides injured, just after the violent clashes on the north bank of Pangong Tso in eastern Ladakh on May 5-6 after multiple PLA incursions into Indian territory. Later, a deadly physical clash at Galwan on June 15 night claimed 20 Indian lives and an unspecified number of Chinese soldiers died too. An Indian Army lieutenant had even punched a major from the PLA during the May 9 clash at Naku La, a sector located at an altitude of about 17,000 feet that has never been contested by China in the past. Though the troop face-off at Naku La had eased after some days, the eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation still continues at the ‘friction points’ in Pangong Tso, Chushul and Gogra-Hotsprings areas of eastern Ladakh. But what had come as a surprise was PLA’s aggressive behaviour in “new areas” like Naku La, which is located ahead of Muguthang in north Sikkim. Naku La has never figured in the 23 “disputed and sensitive areas” that have witnessed frequent transgressions and troop face-offs along the 3,488-km long LAC for years. Pangong Tso figures high on the list, with the other areas in Ladakh being Trig Heights, Demchok, Dumchele, Chumar and Spanggur Gap. In Arunachal, the flashpoints are Namkha Chu, Sumdorong Chu, Asaphila, Dichu, Yangtse and the so-called ‘Fish Tail-I and II’ areas in Dibang Valley. In the middle sector, the disputed areas include Barahoti, Kaurik and Shipki La.
